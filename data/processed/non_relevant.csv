Additional extraneous information will be deleted before evaluation. Proposers are explicitly requested not to make any changes to the template (e.g. no deletion or renaming of work sheets, rows or columns); major deviations from the template may lead to the proposal being rejected without further evaluation.The main section of the proposal – Part B - must not exceed 12 pages in length (including any appendices, but excluding the Part B cover page and excluding the provision of scientific literature references). The Part B text should be no smaller than 11-point Arial font; which applies also to images inserted into the proposal that provide textual information. Proposals submitted with a Part B whose length (excluding the cover page) exceeds the 12-page limit will be rejected without further evaluation.Proposal templates for both Part A and Part B can be found at https://www.ffplus-project.eu/en/open-call/innovation-studies/It is a requirement that these templates be followed and in particular that the breakdown of the proposal budget be provided using the embedded Excel spread-sheets in Part B.

The overall acceptance threshold (summed over all criteria) is set to 10, while a minimum score of 3 must be achieved for each criterion. All criteria are equally weighted. However, in case of a tie in the overall score ranking, proposals are ranked based on the individual criteria scoring applying the following priority: Impact, Excellence, Implementation, and finally total requested funding.The evaluation of proposals will be done by independent, external experts using a consensus review process; which process will be supported by the FFplus beneficiaries coordinating the open call.

It is complementary to and works in synergy with other Pact for Skills initiatives.Implementing vocational excellence approaches features prominently in the overall EU policy for skills and VET put forward in the Union of Skills, the European Education Area, the 2020 Council Recommendation on VET, as well as the Osnabrück Declaration and its successor, the Herning Declaration. The CoVE initiative is firmly anchored in the European Pillar of Social Rights, the European Green Deal, the new Digital Strategy, and supports the Industrial and SME Strategies, the Council Recommendation ‘Europe on the Move’ – learning mobility opportunities for everyone, the STEM Education Strategic Plan, and the Clean Industrial Deal.The Union of Skills is an investment in people for a competitive European Union, which needs skilled people to respond to new challenges and stay competitive. It is an initiative that aims to improve the quality of education, training, and lifelong learning and the Centres of Vocational Excellence can contribute to the Union of Skills and the upcoming VET strategy, also through public-private partnerships, expand the use of micro-credentials, etc.Further, this initiative introduces a European dimension to vocational excellence by supporting the implementation of EU VET policy and actions agreed with Member States, social partners and VET providers.OBJECTIVES OF THE ACTIONThe main objective of the CoVE initiative is the establishment and development of transnational collaborative networks that bring together local and regional VET stakeholders (VET institutions, companies and other employers, social partners, authorities, higher education institutions, research institutes, etc.) in strong and broad public-private partnerships, thereby creating comprehensive skills ecosystems for innovation, regional development, and social inclusion and supporting European competitiveness.The Centres of Vocational Excellence aim at achieving the following objectives:to ensure high quality skills through flexible and learner-centred VET provisions that lead to quality employment and career-long opportunities, swiftly responding to the needs of an innovative, inclusive, competitive and sustainable economy as well as to societal needs;to support and act as drivers for local and regional development, innovation and social inclusion;to contribute to upward convergence on VET excellence, to increase the quality of VET at system level in more and more countries;to ensure that outputs and results are taken into use and have impact beyond the project partner organisations and beyond the project period. SCOPE OF THE ACTIONThe CoVEs are expected to develop innovative VET practices, e.g. for use of digital technologies, including AI, contribute to VET attractiveness and inclusion as well as applied research and innovation, facilitate mobility and apprenticeships and professional development of teachers and trainers, work together on joint VET provisions incl. micro-credentials, etc.The Centres of Vocational Excellence operate at two levels:1. At national level, involving a wide range of local stakeholders creating skills ecosystems for local innovation, regional development, and social inclusion, while working with CoVEs in other countries through international collaborative networks.2. At transnational level, bringing together CoVEs that share a common interest in:▪ specific sectors;▪ innovative approaches to tackle economic and societal challenges (e.g. climate change, digitalisation, artificial intelligence, sustainable development goals [See Berlin Declaration on Education for SDG ], integration of migrants and disadvantaged groups, upskilling people with low qualification levels, etc.), or▪ innovative approaches to increase the outreach, quality and effectiveness of existing CoVEs.For more information, see the Erasmus + Programme Guide 2026.Show more Topic descriptionScope:CENTRES OF VOCATIONAL EXCELLENCECentres of Vocational Excellence (CoVE) aim to be a driving force for reforms in the Vocational Education Training (VET) sector, ensuring high quality skills and competences that lead to quality employment and career-long opportunities, meeting the","alicorn","Alicorn","no"

Objective: Capacity-building in the field of youth projects are international cooperation projects based on multilateral partnerships between organisations active in the field of youth in the EU and countries associated to the Programme, on the one hand, and in third countries not associated to the Programme, on the other hand. For the latter, this action targets exclusively countries in Region 9 (Sub Saharan Africa). Projects shall aim both at, on one hand, supporting international cooperation in the field of youth and non-formal learning, as a driver of sustainable socio-economic development and well-being among youth organisations and young people and, on the other, at promoting the mobility of young people to encourage their active participation in society as well as to help them acquire and develop competences for life and for their professional future. In specific, projects shall: Raise the capacity of organisations working with young people outside formal learning;Promote non-formal learning in the eligible third countries not associated to the Programme, especially in organisations that target young people with fewer opportunities (through the development, testing and launching of schemes and programmes of non-formal learning mobility in Partner countries);Support the development of youth work in the eligible third countries not associated to the Programme;Foster the development, testing and launching of schemes and programmes allowing organisations to enhance non-formal learning mobility in the eligible third countries not associated to the Programme;Contribute to the achievement of the goals of the Youth Mobility for Africa flagship initiative. This initiative is part of the Global Gateway Africa-Europe Investment Package to increase strategic engagement between the EU and Africa on learning mobility and youth on both continents. The initiative contributes to the Youth Action Plan in External Action (2022-2027) and the commitments made at the 6th EU-African Union Summit in 2022.Support projects that promote the mobility of young people with a view to promoting their active participation in society as well as to helping them acquire and develop competences for life and for their professional future.Foster interregional cooperation;Enhance synergies and complementarities with formal education systems.

Activities under this action should contribute to widening the outreach towards young people to ensure a diversity of voices and reach a diverse range of young people within and beyond youth organisations, including youth with fewer opportunities. They should involve a variety of traditional and digital channels and facilitate the development of partnerships and networks, enabling participation and access for grassroots NGOs and youth movements.European Youth Together projects aim to create networks promoting regional partnerships, to be run in close cooperation with young people from across Europe (EU Member States and third countries associated to the programme). The networks should organise exchanges, promote trainings (for instance for youth leaders) and allow for young people themselves to set up joint projects, all of which can be done through both physical and online activities.OBJECTIVES OF THE ACTIONEuropean Youth Together projects aim to create cooperation, enabling young people across Europe to set up joint projects, organise exchanges and promote trainings (e.g. for youth leaders/ youth workers) through both physical and online activities. The action will support transnational partnerships for youth organisations from both grassroots and large-scale level, aiming to reinforce the European dimension of their activities.Important thematic priorities are working with and promoting the EU Youth Strategy 2019-2027 [1] and the European Youth Goals. The European Youth Goals are also reflected in the President von der Leyen Commission’s political guidelines [2]. Project proposals may also treat the legacy of the European Year of Youth 2022 (e.g., exploration of youth check or youth mainstreaming processes) and the outcomes of the ‘Conference for the Future of Europe’ [Conference on the Future of Europe - European Commission].Youth networks should consider ways of forging solidarity and inclusiveness in the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.SPECIFIC OBJECTIVESThe action seeks to specifically support at least one of the following specific objectives:• the promotion and development of more transnational structured cooperation, online and offline, between different youth organisations to build or strengthen partnerships focusing on solidarity and inclusive democratic participation of all against a backdrop of the backlashes on socio-economic structures and in line with the EU Youth Strategy 2019- 2027, the European Youth Goals, the EU Youth Dialogue and the European Year of Youth 2022 legacy (e.g. youth participation, youth mainstreaming, youth check processes).• the promotion of the six core EU values [3] that form the basis of our society: Respect for human dignity; Freedom; Democracy; Equality, Rule of law and Respect for human rights, including those of minorities.• youth organisations involved in initiatives to encourage young people to participate in the democratic process and in society by organising trainings, showcase commonalities among young Europeans and encourage discussion and debate on their connection to the EU, its values and democratic foundations. This includes organising events linked to the promotion of participation of under-represented groups of young people in politics, youth organisations and other civil society organisations by engaging youth with fewer opportunities such as vulnerable and socio-economic disadvantaged youth and young people from rural and remote areas.• new ways to empower youth organisations, by supporting innovative ways of cooperation and network creation, development and management. Indicatively, this could include enhancing collaboration between youth organisations in a digital context through non-formal learning methods and organisational models such as alternative modes of exchanges and mutual aid. The Declaration of the 4 th European Youth Work Convention of May 2025 and the roadmap for a European Youth Work Strategy should be a new supportive framework for the implementation of the European Youth Work Agenda.• the reinforcement of the European dimension of the activities of grassroots youth organisations, including activities on how to live better together and helping to design sustainable future ways of living transnationally, in line with the European Green Deal and the New European","alicorn","Alicorn","no"

They make it possible for every young person to access high-quality international and cross-cultural education without physical mobility. While virtual debating or training does not fully replace the benefits of physical mobility, participants in virtual exchanges ought to reap some of the benefits of the international educational experience. Digital platforms represent a valuable tool in partially answering the global constraints on mobility caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Virtual exchanges also help spreading European values. Moreover, in some cases, virtual exchanges can give ideas and prepare the ground for future physical exchanges not funded under this action.Virtual exchanges in higher education and youth take place in small groups and are always moderated by a trained facilitator. They should be easily integrated into youth (non-formal education) projects or higher education courses. Virtual exchanges can draw participants from both sectors, even if, depending on specific projects, they could involve participants from either only one of them or from both. All projects under this call will involve organisations and participants coming from both EU Member States and third countries associated to the Programme, and third countries not associated to the Programme in eligible regions.OBJECTIVES OF THE ACTIONThe action will aim to:encourage intercultural dialogue with third countries not associated to the Programme and increase tolerance through online people-to-people interactions, building on digital, youth-friendly technologies;promote various types of virtual exchanges as a complement to Erasmus+ physical mobility, allowing more young people to benefit from intercultural and international experience;enhance critical thinking and media literacy, particularly in the use of internet and social media, such as to counter discrimination, indoctrination, polarization and violent radicalisation;foster the digital and soft skills1 development of students, young people and youth workers2 , including the practice of foreign languages and teamwork, notably to enhance employability;promote citizenship and the common values of freedom, tolerance and non-discrimination through education;strengthen the youth dimension in the relations of the EU with third countries. THEMATIC AREAS / SPECIFIC OBJECTIVESThe virtual exchanges should be organised in one or more of the following thematic areas, which correspond to the priorities of the Erasmus+ Programme:Inclusion and diversity;Digital transformation;Environment and fight against climate change;Participation in democratic life, common values and civic engagement. Within this broad framework, since virtual exchanges are a bottom-up initiative, participating organisations are free to choose the topics on which they will focus, but proposals must demonstrate their expected impact in relation to one or more of the objectives mentioned above (see also ‘Expected impact’ section below). Gender aspects should be taken into account as needed, depending on the projects’ scope and themes (e.g. by introducing gender sensitivity aspects in the trainings). Special attention needs to be given to the inclusion of socially and economically vulnerable people and persons unable to apply for physical mobility.Further information can be found on the dedicated page of the Programme Guide (erasmus-plus.ec.europa.eu/erasmus-programme-guide), please check the latest version for 2026.1 Soft skills include the ability to think critically, be curious and creative, to take initiative, to solve problems and work collaboratively, to be able to communicate efficiently in a multicultural and interdisciplinary environment, to be able to adapt to context and to cope with stress and uncertainty. These skills are part of the key competences, as outlined in the Council Recommendation on Key Competences for Lifelong Learning (OJ C 189/1 of 4.6.2018).2 Youth workers are professional or volunteers involved in non-formal learning who support young people in their personal socio-educational and professional development.Show more Topic descriptionScope:ERASMUS+ VIRTUAL EXCHANGESVirtual exchanges projects consist of online people-to-people activities that promote intercultural dialogue and soft skills development.

They should be easily integrated into youth (non-formal education) projects or higher education courses. Virtual exchanges can draw participants from both sectors, even if, depending on specific projects, they could involve participants from either only one of them or from both. All projects under this call will involve organisations and participants coming from both EU Member States and third countries associated to the Programme, and third countries not associated to the Programme in eligible regions.OBJECTIVES OF THE ACTIONThe action will aim to:encourage intercultural dialogue with third countries not associated to the Programme and increase tolerance through online people-to-people interactions, building on digital, youth-friendly technologies;promote various types of virtual exchanges as a complement to Erasmus+ physical mobility, allowing more young people to benefit from intercultural and international experience;enhance critical thinking and media literacy, particularly in the use of internet and social media, such as to counter discrimination, indoctrination, polarization and violent radicalisation;foster the digital and soft skills1 development of students, young people and youth workers2 , including the practice of foreign languages and teamwork, notably to enhance employability;promote citizenship and the common values of freedom, tolerance and non-discrimination through education;strengthen the youth dimension in the relations of the EU with third countries. THEMATIC AREAS / SPECIFIC OBJECTIVESThe virtual exchanges should be organised in one or more of the following thematic areas, which correspond to the priorities of the Erasmus+ Programme:Inclusion and diversity;Digital transformation;Environment and fight against climate change;Participation in democratic life, common values and civic engagement. Within this broad framework, since virtual exchanges are a bottom-up initiative, participating organisations are free to choose the topics on which they will focus, but proposals must demonstrate their expected impact in relation to one or more of the objectives mentioned above (see also ‘Expected impact’ section below). Gender aspects should be taken into account as needed, depending on the projects’ scope and themes (e.g. by introducing gender sensitivity aspects in the trainings). Special attention needs to be given to the inclusion of socially and economically vulnerable people and persons unable to apply for physical mobility.Further information can be found on the dedicated page of the Programme Guide (erasmus-plus.ec.europa.eu/erasmus-programme-guide), please check the latest version for 2026.1 Soft skills include the ability to think critically, be curious and creative, to take initiative, to solve problems and work collaboratively, to be able to communicate efficiently in a multicultural and interdisciplinary environment, to be able to adapt to context and to cope with stress and uncertainty. These skills are part of the key competences, as outlined in the Council Recommendation on Key Competences for Lifelong Learning (OJ C 189/1 of 4.6.2018).2 Youth workers are professional or volunteers involved in non-formal learning who support young people in their personal socio-educational and professional development.Show more Topic descriptionExpected Outcome:ERASMUS+ VIRTUAL EXCHANGESVirtual exchanges projects consist of online people-to-people activities that promote intercultural dialogue and soft skills development. They make it possible for every young person to access high-quality international and cross-cultural education without physical mobility. While virtual debating or training does not fully replace the benefits of physical mobility, participants in virtual exchanges ought to reap some of the benefits of the international educational experience.

They also aim to boost the provision of new skills and address skills mismatches by designing and creating new curricula for higher education (HE) and vocational education and training (VET), supporting the development of a sense of initiative and entrepreneurial mind-sets in the EU. OBJECTIVES OF THE ACTION These partnerships shall implement a coherent and comprehensive set of sectoral or cross-sectoral activities, which should be adaptable to future knowledge developments across the EU. To boost innovation, the focus will be on talent and skills development. Firstly, digital competences have become increasingly important in all job profiles across the entire labour market. Secondly, the transition to a circular and greener economy needs to be underpinned by changes to qualifications and national education and training curricula to meet emerging professional needs for green skills and sustainable development. Thirdly, the twin digital and green transition requires an accelerated adoption of new technologies across all sectors of our economy and society and boosting STEM skills and talent. Lot 2: Alliances for Sectoral Cooperation on Skills (implementing the ‘Blueprint’) Alliances for Sectoral Cooperation on Skills aim to create new strategic approaches and cooperation for concrete skills development solutions – both in the short and the medium term – in areas implementing a major action of the European Skills Agenda for sustainable competitiveness, social fairness and resilience, the Pact for Skills, an action launched under the European Skills Agenda in 2020 and now a major element of the sector based approach of the Union of Skills, the overarching European skills strategy. The initiative provides large-scale partnerships established under the Pact for Skills, with the opportunity to support the development of sector skills strategies, as well as the revision and development of job profiles and of related training programmes. The main objective of the Pact is to mobilise and incentivize all relevant stakeholders and leverage public-private partnerships to take concrete actions for the upskilling and reskilling of the workforce, by pooling efforts and setting up partnerships, also at EU level, addressing the needs of the labour market, supporting green and digital transitions as well as national, regional and local skills and growth strategies. Therefore, the deliverables of Alliances for Sectoral Cooperation on Skills, i.e. sectoral skills intelligence, skills strategies, occupational profiles, training programmes, and long-term planning, will be an important contribution to the work of the ecosystem-based large-scale partnerships that have joined the Pact for Skills. Alliances for Sectoral Cooperation on Skills seek to tackle skills gaps on the labour market that hamper growth, innovation and competitiveness in specific sectors or areas, aiming both at short term interventions and long-term strategies. These Alliances will be implemented in the 14 industrial ecosystems identified in the New Industrial Strategy for Europe1 (see eligibility criteria).

Thirdly, the twin digital and green transition requires an accelerated adoption of new technologies across all sectors of our economy and society and boosting STEM skills and talent.Lot 1: Alliances for Education and EnterprisesAlliances for Education and Enterprises are transnational, structured and result-driven projects, in which partners share common goals and work together to foster innovation, new skills, a sense of initiative and entrepreneurial mind-sets.They aim to foster innovation in higher education, vocational education and training, enterprises and the broader socio-economic environment. This includes confronting societal and economic challenges such as climate change, changing demographics, digitisation, the emergence of new, disruptive technologies such as artificial intelligence generating demand for STEM skills and talent and rapid employment changes through social innovation and community resilience as well as labour market innovation. In 2026, this topic will also address the challenge of severe skills gaps in sectors crucial for Europe’s competitiveness in line with the Union of Skills initiative.Alliances for Education and Enterprises bring together enterprises and both higher education and vocational training providers to work together in partnership. Operating within one economic sector or several different economic sectors, they create reliable and sustainable relations and demonstrate their innovative and transnational character in all aspects. While each partnership must include at least one VET and one higher education organisation, they can address either both or one of these educational fields. The cooperation between VET and higher education organisations should be relevant and should benefit both sectors.They intend to achieve one or more of the following aims:Fostering new, innovative and multidisciplinary approaches to teaching and learning: fostering innovation in education design and delivery, teaching methods, assessment techniques, learning environments and/or developing new skills;Supporting skills development in the STEM domains; supporting Europe’s innovation capacity by broadening its talent pool for new, disruptive technologies;Fostering the setting up of incubators within education and training institutions across Europe;Fostering corporate social responsibility (e.g. equity, inclusion, climate change, environmental protection and sustainable development); Stimulating a sense of initiative and entrepreneurial attitudes, mind-sets and skills in learners, educational staffand other workers, in line with the Entrepreneurship Competence Framework (EntreComp)[ https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC101581/lfna27939enn.pdf];Improving the quality and relevance of skills developed and certified through education and training systems (including new skills and tackling skills mismatches);Facilitating the exchange and co-creation of knowledge between higher education and vocational education and training, research, the public sector and the business sector;Building and supporting effective and efficient higher education and vocational education and training systems, which are connected, inclusive and contribute to innovation.Supporting dedicated joint programmes or developing jointly micro-credentials and supporting mentorship for start up and scale ups in sectors crucial for Europe’s competitiveness where severe skills gaps occur. Higher education institutions are encouraged to use the HEInnovate self-assessment tool [ https://heinnovate.eu/en] before applying, above all if they are coordinating the proposal.

For Strands 1 and 2, the applicable priorities are further detailed in the regional context as follows: Green Deal: Two main elements have a critical impact on the Caribbean: i) climate change and natural disasters and ii) unsustainable production and excessive generation of waste. Both put the Caribbean marine and terrestrial ecosystems under pressure and vulnerable to external shocks. Projects should contribute to adapt to climate change and reduce risks in areas as transition to low-carbon economies, renewable energy, waste management, agri-food value chains.Digital transformation: The regional Multiannual Indicative Programme for Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) region generally advances the external dimension of EC priorities, notably for digital transformation. In an island region, investment in digital skills, infrastructure and inclusion is required: at LAC level, the EU has created an EU-LAC Digital Alliance to pursue each element of this agenda, while digital cooperation is embedded with within the connectivity dimension of Global Gateway, and BELLA (Building Europe Link to Latin America) connects universities and innovation centres in EU, Latin America and Caribbean.Governance, peace, security and human development: To contribute to more inclusive and resilient societies and advance on social cohesion, projects should create knowledge, awareness as well as capacity in areas as education, health, gender equality and inclusiveness.Sustainable growth and jobs: Developing knowledge, in connection with the labour market needs, in areas with growth potential (such as creative industries and services) and emerging sectors (blue, green, and digital economy) can generate a multiplying effect. Projects can contribute to find regional solutions to common challenges such as connectivity and regional integration, as well reducing youth unemployment rates and brain drain.For those proposals that also refer to an Erasmus+ Global Gateway relevant priority, applicants should select the ‘Global Gateway’ fixed keyword in the relevant field, alongside any other fixed keyword options relevant to their proposal.For Strand 3 and given the nature of the strand, which aims at supporting structural reforms in the third countries not associated to the Programme, proposals must address the needs of higher education in the country(ies) concerned at large. In this Region, Strand 3 proposals must be aligned with the Erasmus+ Global Gateway-related priorities defined at country (or cluster of countries) level - see hyperlink below.These priorities are available under the corresponding table of the following link: https://international-partnerships.ec.europa.eu/policies/global-gateway/erasmus-global-gateway-priorities_enApplicants submitting proposals in this Strand under Region 11 – Caribbean should propose academic capacity building aspects that well align with the Global Gateway investment priorities and projects for the country/region concerned.

For Strands 1 and 2, the applicable priorities are further detailed in the regional context as follows: Green Deal: One of the objectives of the EU in the Region is to accelerate the transition towards a green and circular economy, as Central Asia has a great potential for green energy. Projects should thus accelerate the transition towards a green and circular economy and tackle trans-regional environmental challenges through accompanying links with the private sector as well as enhanced study and educational capacities.Digital transformation: The EU’s Central Asia strategy - re-affirmed in the 2025 EU-Central Asia Summit - is built around cooperation on digital connections, transport, energy and people-to-people contacts. Projects should focus on improving the digital economy and digital infrastructure for skills development and job creation.Sustainable growth and jobs: The development of skills will be key to Central Asia’s competitiveness and social cohesion. Projects should promote knowledge-based economies and enhance synergies between education systems and the labour market, and should be linked with promoting digital literacy and skills.

For Strands 1 and 2, the applicable priorities are further detailed in the regional context as follows: Green Deal: Projects should contribute to an inclusive, long-term socio-economic recovery and tap into the Region’s economic potential by supporting the circular and green economy as well as urban development. Priorities include increasing climate awareness, sustainability and resilience, specifically in the key sectors of agriculture, energy and water management. Furthermore, academic cooperation should aim to provide applicable answers to environmental challenges, including desertification, biodiversity loss and use of natural resources.Digital transformation: Projects should seize the digital transition by working on digital literacy, skills and entrepreneurship. In parallel, digital solutions can provide new means to reach out to vulnerable communities. Cooperation opportunities also lie in digital infrastructure and connections, where heightened reliability, capacity and security will support regional economic integration.Integration of migrants: Education access for displaced persons and refugees is a priority objective for the entire Region. Support intra-regional initiatives on credential and degree recognition as well as regional credit transfer systems. Opportunities and jobs, as referred to in the other regional priorities, should be inclusive of all, including migrants and displaced persons.Governance, peace, security and human development: Commitment to the rule of law, human and fundamental rights, equality, democracy and good governance are the bedrock of stable, fair and prosperous societies. Initiatives on peace and security, intercultural dialogue and women empowerment are encouraged, hereby driving respect for diversity, tolerance and strengthening the Mediterranean partnership.Sustainable growth and jobs: Improving education systems governance and addressing structural causes of schools dropouts are crucial to meet youth aspirations and to address persisting economic and gender inequalities. An integral part to this process is developing primary and secondary teacher education and in-service training. Stronger linkages between the academic, research and business world are to be stimulated, with education programmes addressing current and future skills needs, not in the least entrepreneurship. Innovation hubs and start-ups help generate local employment opportunities and prevent brain drain.

For Strands 1 and 2, the applicable priorities are further detailed in the regional context as follows: Green Deal: There is no other Region in the world more threatened by climate change and engaged in climate action, as environmental degradation greatly hampers deeper development in the Pacific. Projects should therefore help to modernise economies in the Region by establishing links with the private sector, as well as creating knowledge and capacity to help the Region further adapt to climate change and a changing work dynamic. Digital transformation: Digital governance and partnerships as well as connectivity both feature as one of the seven priority areas for the EU’s strategy for cooperation in the Indo-Pacific and the 2023 Digital Compass. The digital transition is a priority for Global Gateway value chain priorities for individual countries, which face the challenges of distance and insularity. Digitalisation also plays an important role in strategies for transport, while digital governance is a building block in the EU’s relations with the wider Asia-Pacific region. Sustainable growth and jobs: The countries of the Pacific Region suffer from a very narrow market size, offering very few job opportunities. Projects should support the creation of stable and reliable internal repositories of knowledge and competencies, avoiding a brain drain and enhancing the domestic education systems. In this respect, one of the main cornerstones will be the development of the “blue economy” concept. For those proposals that also refer to an Erasmus+ Global Gateway relevant priority, applicants should select the ‘Global Gateway’ fixed keyword in the relevant field, alongside any other fixed keyword options relevant to their proposal.For Strand 3 and given the nature of the strand, which aims at supporting structural reforms in the third countries not associated to the Programme, proposals must address the needs of higher education in the country(ies) concerned at large. In this Region, Strand 3 proposals must be aligned with the Erasmus+ Global Gateway-related priorities defined at country (or cluster of countries) level - see hyperlink below.These priorities are available under the corresponding table of the following link:https://international-partnerships.ec.europa.eu/policies/global-gateway/erasmus-global-gateway-priorities_enApplicants submitting proposals in this Strand under Region 8a – Pacific should propose academic capacity building aspects that well align with the Global Gateway investment priorities and projects for the country/region concerned. This requirement is essential and will be carefully evaluated as part of the Relevance award criterion.In addition, each applicant will need to identify in Part A of the application form one of the overarching priorities, which are defined by the European Commission and reflected in the Programme Guide.

For Strands 1 and 2, the applicable priorities are further detailed in the regional context as follows: Green Deal: Projects should promote long-term economic recovery by increasing the Region’s competitiveness and stimulating green jobs. Priority areas include climate, environment, circular economy and fighting pollution. Projects should pave the way to a climate neutral society by supporting reforms of education systems in order to guarantee that people are equipped and prepared for the labour market and society of tomorrow. Digital transformation: Projects should support the development and uptake of digital skills to make the digital transformation as comprehensive and inclusive as possible. Encourage development and implementation of digital education strategies. Accompany the digital transition by mainstreaming digitalisation in education systems and reinforcing programmes covering digital skills. Provide assistance to teacher training and online education learning. Integration of migrants: Projects should promote mobility and in particular, support recognition of degrees and credentials in the Region, and contribute to a regional credit transfer system to enable intra-regional connectivity and building a regional higher education area. Governance, peace, security and human development: Address regional structural weaknesses by supporting cooperation and/or reforms in the areas of governance, rule of law and the fight against corruption. Project proposals centred on health governance are encouraged, particularly those linked to preparedness and resilience. Sustainable growth and jobs: Quality education is a key factor for securing growth and jobs and for addressing challenges linked to unemployment and skills mismatches. Investing in human capital and entrepreneurship helps societies to prepare for the future, by putting a halt to brain drain and supporting the transition to a knowledge-based economy. A key objective is to tackle the existing mismatch between education outcomes and labour market demands, including through the development of work-based learning. Inclusive participation of all citizens, including Roma, in education and training systems will ensure that no one is left behind.

For Strands 1 and 2, the applicable priorities are further detailed in the regional context of the various Regions as follows :Region 1: Western BalkansGreen Deal: Projects should promote long-term economic recovery by increasing the Region’s competitiveness and stimulating green jobs. Priority areas include climate, environment, circular economy and fighting pollution. Projects should pave the way to a climate neutral society by supporting reforms of education systems in order to guarantee that people are equipped and prepared for the labour market and society of tomorrow.Digital transformation: Projects should support the development and uptake of digital skills to make the digital transformation as comprehensive and inclusive as possible. Encourage development and implementation of digital education strategies. Accompany the digital transition by mainstreaming digitalisation in education systems and reinforcing programmes covering digital skills. Provide assistance to teacher training and online education learning.Integration of migrants: Projects should promote mobility and in particular, support recognition of degrees and credentials in the Region, and contribute to a regional credit transfer system to enable intra-regional connectivity and building a regional higher education area.Governance, peace, security and human development: Address regional structural weaknesses by supporting cooperation and/or reforms in the areas of governance, rule of law and the fight against corruption. Project proposals centred on health governance are encouraged, particularly those linked to preparedness and resilience.Sustainable growth and jobs: Quality education is a key factor for securing growth and jobs and for addressing challenges linked to unemployment and skills mismatches. Investing in human capital and entrepreneurship helps societies to prepare for the future, by putting a halt to brain drain and supporting the transition to a knowledge-based economy. A key objective is to tackle the existing mismatch between education outcomes and labour market demands, including through the development of work-based learning. Inclusiveness participation of all citizens, including Roma, in education and training systems will ensure that no one is left behind.Region 2: Neighbourhood EastGreen Deal: Support the modernisation of economies, making them more competitive and innovative, while ensuring the green transition towards climate neutrality. Research & innovation initiatives are to focus upon climate change mitigation and adaptation, the greening of cities, promotion and implementation of new sustainable value chains and green skills & jobs. Academic cooperation should help provide answers to public demands on urban and rural development, energy efficiency, health and natural resource and waste management.Digital transformation: Foster an effective, inclusive and gender-sensitive digital transformation in education and science, in the first place by addressing the digital skills gap. Priority areas in the digital strand include the development of connectivity solutions empowering citizens through the improvement of digital skills and digital literacy, distance learning, and learning and teaching innovations, specifically in remote and rural areas and vulnerable communities. Priority should also be given to fostering links between Education, Research and Business in the area of digitalisation. Calls related to Data infrastructure, Data management and SME/business digitalisation are encouraged.Integration of migrants: Support education initiatives contributing to the development of a regional higher education area, particularly credit transfer systems and qualification, degree and credential recognition.","alicorn","Alicorn","no"

For Strands 1 and 2, the applicable priorities are further detailed in the regional context as follows:Green Deal: Projects should contribute to a green and sustainable economic recovery and transition as well as climate change mitigation and adaptation by supporting reforms of education systems and by strengthening links with the private sector, while also exposing higher education institutions in the Region to European practices. Digital transformation: Projects should address digital teaching, learning and literacy, and the role of digital skills in job creation and employability. EU policy towards countries in this region also seeks to enhance the transparency of governance through digitalised institutions, e-government and e-services. Sustainable growth and jobs: Projects should support the Region’s diversification and sustainable development and address the mismatch between the education system and needs of the labour market, also providing support to team up with the private sector, to foster economies that work for all. Projects could be linked with the Green Deal priority by enhancing educational capacities concerning the Region’s green transition.

For Strands 1 and 2, the applicable priorities are further detailed in the regional context as follows: Green Deal: Latin American countries are key partners for a global transition towards a greener and climate neutral development path. The Region is home to around of 50% of the global biodiversity and has a tremendous potential for renewable, but also is highly vulnerable to negative impacts of climate change and natural disasters. Projects should respond to those environmental challenges enhancing capacities in the Region. Projects should also support the private sector for their green and economic transition and enhance the needed knowledge and skills. Digital transformation: Digital transformation can support sustainable recovery in Latin American countries, address traps and increase competitiveness. Projects should help to bridge the digital divide, developing digital literacy and skills, as well as scientific, technical and innovation capacities fostering links between education, research and business. Earth observation and spatial technologies allow increasing climate change mitigation and creating innovation paths. Governance, peace, security and human development: Strengthening social cohesion remains a priority for the Region, which is the most unequal of the world. Projects should contribute to build inclusive societies by developing awareness and strengthening capacities in areas such as education, health, gender equality, access and inclusion, human rights, including social, economic, and cultural rights. Particular attention should be given to vulnerable communities as well as remote and rural areas. Projects support intra-regional connectivity and contribute to the development of the Higher Education Area, particularly the recognition of degrees and credit transfer systems and qualifications. Projects should support the integration of migrants, refugees and displaced persons as well, through the access to education. Sustainable growth and jobs: To accompany the Region to a sustainable inclusive economic recovery, projects should put the accent to respond to the needs of emerging sectors, as green, blue, digital and orange economy. Projects should also help to identify education gaps in the different areas in close cooperation with the private sector. For those proposals that also refer to an Erasmus+ Global Gateway relevant priority, applicants should select the ‘Global Gateway’ fixed keyword in the relevant field, alongside any other fixed keyword options relevant to their proposal.For Strand 3 and given the nature of the strand, which aims at supporting structural reforms in the third countries not associated to the Programme, proposals must address the needs of higher education in the country(ies) concerned at large.
