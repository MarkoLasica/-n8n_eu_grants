It will:Accelerate the development and validation of disruptive NAMs for biomedical applications, including medicinal products and medical technologiesSupport regulatory innovation by providing evidence-based recommendations for the assessment of safety, efficacy, and quality of human health products using NAMs.Enable citizens to benefit from novel technologies that have been assessed through rigorous NAMs that have been validated to can predict potential effects in humans, andProvide industry with a harmonised and standardised NAM-based assessment toolkit that is faster and more flexible. Objective:Specific Objectives This is a two-stage Challenge competition with the ultimate ambition to deliver robust, validated NAMs that constitute a representative model or prototype system i.e. achieve TRL 6 after Stage 2. Applicants should apply to Stage 1 only where there is an outlook of the potential impact in the longer term.Stage 1 – Solution validation and benchmarking Applicants should:Take forward preliminary engagement with regulatory authorities, notified bodies and industry stakeholdersMap regulatory, clinical, standardisation (where applicable) and industrial needs, and use this to develop a roadmap for adoptionDevelop a methodology for performance assessmentDeliver small-scale feasibility experiments or modellingConduct initial performance benchmarking (human relevance, reproducibility, transferability of the approach)Assess ethical, data governance and scalability considerations, as applicable to the given NAM under development. The following milestones need to be achieved at the end of Stage 1:Evidence that the NAM is viable for human relevant biomedical innovation, and addresses the needs of the identified use cases, andClear commitment from industrial end-users and a well-defined regulatory plan to further develop the NAM in Stage 2. Progress to Stage 2 will be contingent on delivering a full proposal which will be assessed alongside the milestones achieved under Stage 1.Stage 2 – Development and user testing Applicants selected for Stage 2 will further develop and validate a functional, scalable NAM prototype ready for regulatory, industrial, or clinical uptake. Activities must cover a number of the following elements:Benchmarking the NAMs against state-of-the-art animal models and/or human trialsDemonstration in relevant application, such as disease modelling, or testing of medicinal products and medical technologies for safety, efficacy, or qualityOrganisation of consultation meetings/workshops with industrial end users, regulators, CROs (Contract Research Organisations), standard setting bodies or other relevant stakeholders to gather further needs and feedbackEngagement with infrastructures for testing and data collection as testing and validation of the NAM outside the developer’s labDevelopment of regulatory-grade data packages suitable for submission to relevant agencies (e.g. EMA, FDA, OECD), andDocumentation on scalability, standardisation, and potential barriers to uptake. During the project’s implementation phase, beneficiaries will be encouraged to consider using the EU Reference Laboratory for alternatives to animal testing (EURL ECVAM) of the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre for aspects of standardisation, automation and validation of in vitro methods. These facilities operate and provide support at the interface between pre-normative research, regulatory sciences and innovation.Scope:New Approach Methodologies (NAMs) have the potential to replace, reduce or refine animal use in the testing96 of medicinal products. Scientific progress in recent decades has delivered several animal-free NAMs that have the potential to transform how we understand human biology and assess the safety, efficacy, and quality testing in the health sector. However, a lack of knowledge, experience and confidence in the use of such novel methodologies has limited their adoption by end users, including, for example, industry and regulators.This Challenge competition therefore looks to accelerate the adoption of NAMs in biomedicine and support companies that want to bring NAMs to the market. Applicants should propose innovative and disruptive NAMs addressing one or both of the following areas:Preclinical biomedical researchTesting of medicinal products and medical technologies for safety, efficacy, or quality. Human organoids or microphysiological systems (e.g. organ-on-chip, disease-on-chip), in chemico methods, digital twins, virtual patient simulations, AI-enhanced predictive models, mechanistic or integrated in silico platforms, 3D- advanced human tissue model are in scope.Applicants to this Challenge call should already have:Proven the viability of their proposed solution in a lab environment at TRL 4 (lab or in silico);Have letters of intent of at least one of the following stakeholders: an industrial end-user or regulatory body interested in the proposed project; andHave access to an appropriate infrastructure to carry out the planned activities in Stage 1 and 2.

The AI powered robotics models developed under this Challenge are expected to comply with the EU concept for Trustworthy AI and the relevant ethical principles with due attention paid to data quality, transparency and accountability, privacy, security and safety. In the medium to longer term, it is expected to reduce European dependencies and support end users in leveraging advances in AI to enhance their products and develop new capabilities that will contribute to:Strengthened European leadership in physical AI, reducing reliance on non-European technology providers, andContribution to EU priorities in sustainability, resilience, digital transformation, and industrial competitiveness. Objective:This is a two-stage Challenge competition of which the ultimate ambition is to deliver scalable prototypes, validated in a relevant real-world environment. Solutions supported under the Challenge are expected to demonstrate both the novelty and applicability of the proposed Physical AI technology, while mitigating associated risks.Applicant to Stage 1 must also have a clear outlook on the potential longer-term impact(s).Stage1- Solution validation and benchmarking Applicants with disruptive physical AI systems that have achieved a prototype (i.e. at least TRL 4) will be invited to:Refine and validate the prototype in a relevant environment to demonstrate the core innovation (e.g., new perception (multimodal), actuation, continual learning, or autonomy capability, etc.). in the end use caseDevelop a methodology for performance assessmentAssess ethical, data governance and scalability considerationsIdentify challenges to integration such as safety, certification or scalability with view to identifying risks and exploring options for overcoming barriers for adoption including in cases where products’ risks are not covered by the AI ActConduct initial performance benchmarking, andDevelop an initial market analysis, business plan and model. The outputs of Stage 1 will be assessed for progress against the following milestones:Evidence of technical viability with initial performance data that benchmarks performance and disruptive potential against the state-of-the-art in at least one pilot case within the specified application area, andClear commitment from end users and stakeholders to further develop the physical AI solution in Stage 2.To maximise impact, foster collaboration, and accelerate learning across funded teams, Progress to Stage 2 will be contingent on delivering a full proposal which will be assessed alongside the milestones achieved under Stage 1. Stage 2 - Development and user testing Applicants for Stage 2 will be expected to further develop and validate a Physical AI system through the following activities:Build and test (ensure at least two deployments loops) a robust, integrated solution capable of autonomous operation in complex or semi-structured environments (e.g., pilot deployment in real world environment, etc.) to reach TRL 6-7Address scalability and manufacturability: show that the solution can be scaled or adapted for broader integration and deploymentConduct necessary testing, documentation, and compliance activities towards certification or regulatory approval of the adapted solutionOrganisation of consultation meetings/workshops with industrial end users, regulators, standard setting bodies or other relevant stakeholders to gather further needs and feedback, andDevelop a roadmap to commercialisation: refine market analysis, and validate business plan including stakeholder engagement, and identification of scaling strategies At the end of Stage 2, projects will be expected to have:Delivered a robust, integrated solution capable of autonomous operation in complex or semi-structured environments i.e. capable of pilot deployment in real world environmentDemonstrated reliability, adaptability, energy/resource efficiency, and safe human-AI interaction, andProvided evidence of necessary testing, documentation, and compliance activities towards certification or regulatory approval for the adapted solution Scope:Background and ScopeThe integration of AI into physical systems is accelerating apace.

It will:Accelerate the development and validation of disruptive NAMs for biomedical applications, including medicinal products and medical technologiesSupport regulatory innovation by providing evidence-based recommendations for the assessment of safety, efficacy, and quality of human health products using NAMs.Enable citizens to benefit from novel technologies that have been assessed through rigorous NAMs that have been validated to can predict potential effects in humans, andProvide industry with a harmonised and standardised NAM-based assessment toolkit that is faster and more flexible. Objective:Specific Objectives This is a two-stage Challenge competition with the ultimate ambition to deliver robust, validated NAMs that constitute a representative model or prototype system i.e. achieve TRL 6 after Stage 2. Applicants should apply to Stage 1 only where there is an outlook of the potential impact in the longer term.Stage 1 – Solution validation and benchmarking Applicants should:Take forward preliminary engagement with regulatory authorities, notified bodies and industry stakeholdersMap regulatory, clinical, standardisation (where applicable) and industrial needs, and use this to develop a roadmap for adoptionDevelop a methodology for performance assessmentDeliver small-scale feasibility experiments or modellingConduct initial performance benchmarking (human relevance, reproducibility, transferability of the approach)Assess ethical, data governance and scalability considerations, as applicable to the given NAM under development. The following milestones need to be achieved at the end of Stage 1:Evidence that the NAM is viable for human relevant biomedical innovation, and addresses the needs of the identified use cases, andClear commitment from industrial end-users and a well-defined regulatory plan to further develop the NAM in Stage 2. Progress to Stage 2 will be contingent on delivering a full proposal which will be assessed alongside the milestones achieved under Stage 1.Stage 2 – Development and user testing Applicants selected for Stage 2 will further develop and validate a functional, scalable NAM prototype ready for regulatory, industrial, or clinical uptake. Activities must cover a number of the following elements:Benchmarking the NAMs against state-of-the-art animal models and/or human trialsDemonstration in relevant application, such as disease modelling, or testing of medicinal products and medical technologies for safety, efficacy, or qualityOrganisation of consultation meetings/workshops with industrial end users, regulators, CROs (Contract Research Organisations), standard setting bodies or other relevant stakeholders to gather further needs and feedbackEngagement with infrastructures for testing and data collection as testing and validation of the NAM outside the developer’s labDevelopment of regulatory-grade data packages suitable for submission to relevant agencies (e.g. EMA, FDA, OECD), andDocumentation on scalability, standardisation, and potential barriers to uptake. During the project’s implementation phase, beneficiaries will be encouraged to consider using the EU Reference Laboratory for alternatives to animal testing (EURL ECVAM) of the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre for aspects of standardisation, automation and validation of in vitro methods. These facilities operate and provide support at the interface between pre-normative research, regulatory sciences and innovation.Scope:New Approach Methodologies (NAMs) have the potential to replace, reduce or refine animal use in the testing96 of medicinal products. Scientific progress in recent decades has delivered several animal-free NAMs that have the potential to transform how we understand human biology and assess the safety, efficacy, and quality testing in the health sector. However, a lack of knowledge, experience and confidence in the use of such novel methodologies has limited their adoption by end users, including, for example, industry and regulators.This Challenge competition therefore looks to accelerate the adoption of NAMs in biomedicine and support companies that want to bring NAMs to the market. Applicants should propose innovative and disruptive NAMs addressing one or both of the following areas:Preclinical biomedical researchTesting of medicinal products and medical technologies for safety, efficacy, or quality. Human organoids or microphysiological systems (e.g. organ-on-chip, disease-on-chip), in chemico methods, digital twins, virtual patient simulations, AI-enhanced predictive models, mechanistic or integrated in silico platforms, 3D- advanced human tissue model are in scope.Applicants to this Challenge call should already have:Proven the viability of their proposed solution in a lab environment at TRL 4 (lab or in silico);Have letters of intent of at least one of the following stakeholders: an industrial end-user or regulatory body interested in the proposed project; andHave access to an appropriate infrastructure to carry out the planned activities in Stage 1 and 2.

It will:Accelerate the development and validation of disruptive NAMs for biomedical applications, including medicinal products and medical technologiesSupport regulatory innovation by providing evidence-based recommendations for the assessment of safety, efficacy, and quality of human health products using NAMs.Enable citizens to benefit from novel technologies that have been assessed through rigorous NAMs that have been validated to can predict potential effects in humans, andProvide industry with a harmonised and standardised NAM-based assessment toolkit that is faster and more flexible. Objective:Specific Objectives This is a two-stage Challenge competition with the ultimate ambition to deliver robust, validated NAMs that constitute a representative model or prototype system i.e. achieve TRL 6 after Stage 2. Applicants should apply to Stage 1 only where there is an outlook of the potential impact in the longer term.Stage 1 – Solution validation and benchmarking Applicants should:Take forward preliminary engagement with regulatory authorities, notified bodies and industry stakeholdersMap regulatory, clinical, standardisation (where applicable) and industrial needs, and use this to develop a roadmap for adoptionDevelop a methodology for performance assessmentDeliver small-scale feasibility experiments or modellingConduct initial performance benchmarking (human relevance, reproducibility, transferability of the approach)Assess ethical, data governance and scalability considerations, as applicable to the given NAM under development. The following milestones need to be achieved at the end of Stage 1:Evidence that the NAM is viable for human relevant biomedical innovation, and addresses the needs of the identified use cases, andClear commitment from industrial end-users and a well-defined regulatory plan to further develop the NAM in Stage 2. Progress to Stage 2 will be contingent on delivering a full proposal which will be assessed alongside the milestones achieved under Stage 1.Stage 2 – Development and user testing Applicants selected for Stage 2 will further develop and validate a functional, scalable NAM prototype ready for regulatory, industrial, or clinical uptake. Activities must cover a number of the following elements:Benchmarking the NAMs against state-of-the-art animal models and/or human trialsDemonstration in relevant application, such as disease modelling, or testing of medicinal products and medical technologies for safety, efficacy, or qualityOrganisation of consultation meetings/workshops with industrial end users, regulators, CROs (Contract Research Organisations), standard setting bodies or other relevant stakeholders to gather further needs and feedbackEngagement with infrastructures for testing and data collection as testing and validation of the NAM outside the developer’s labDevelopment of regulatory-grade data packages suitable for submission to relevant agencies (e.g. EMA, FDA, OECD), andDocumentation on scalability, standardisation, and potential barriers to uptake. During the project’s implementation phase, beneficiaries will be encouraged to consider using the EU Reference Laboratory for alternatives to animal testing (EURL ECVAM) of the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre for aspects of standardisation, automation and validation of in vitro methods. These facilities operate and provide support at the interface between pre-normative research, regulatory sciences and innovation.Scope:New Approach Methodologies (NAMs) have the potential to replace, reduce or refine animal use in the testing96 of medicinal products. Scientific progress in recent decades has delivered several animal-free NAMs that have the potential to transform how we understand human biology and assess the safety, efficacy, and quality testing in the health sector. However, a lack of knowledge, experience and confidence in the use of such novel methodologies has limited their adoption by end users, including, for example, industry and regulators.This Challenge competition therefore looks to accelerate the adoption of NAMs in biomedicine and support companies that want to bring NAMs to the market. Applicants should propose innovative and disruptive NAMs addressing one or both of the following areas:Preclinical biomedical researchTesting of medicinal products and medical technologies for safety, efficacy, or quality. Human organoids or microphysiological systems (e.g. organ-on-chip, disease-on-chip), in chemico methods, digital twins, virtual patient simulations, AI-enhanced predictive models, mechanistic or integrated in silico platforms, 3D- advanced human tissue model are in scope.Applicants to this Challenge call should already have:Proven the viability of their proposed solution in a lab environment at TRL 4 (lab or in silico);Have letters of intent of at least one of the following stakeholders: an industrial end-user or regulatory body interested in the proposed project; andHave access to an appropriate infrastructure to carry out the planned activities in Stage 1 and 2.

Scope:This action builds upon the EU’s strategic vision outlined in the EU Competitiveness Compass[1], the EIC scaling strategy[2], and the EU Startup and Scaleup Strategy[3]. It aligns with the objectives of strengthening Europe’s deep tech capabilities, increasing regional innovation cohesion and supporting the growth of globally competitive companies.The EU must act decisively to close the innovation gap with other world regions by enabling more commercial successes based on its scientific excellence. While Europe generates world-class research, European deep tech startups often struggle to scale into global champions. The European Startup & Scaleup Hubs (ESSH) pilot will address this structural weakness by creating a connected network of Europe’s leading and emerging startup supporting structures, embedded in innovation ecosystems that bring together universities, research and higher education institutions, research and technology organisations, corporates, entrepreneurs and investors, while also encouraging these hubs to expand their activities.The action aims to pilot a network of around 10-18 ESSHs — highly capable startup and scaleup hubs deeply integrated with leading research, technology and higher education institutions and strong track records in venture building, scaling, and investment attraction as well as providing entrepreneurial education. These hubs shall collaborate across borders to:Open their ecosystems to non-local startups, enabling scaling through access to talent, corporates, capital, infrastructure, facilities and mentoring.Foster shared infrastructure and expertise, including access to labs, facilities, research departments, and innovation services.Support pan-European startup development, for both local and network-partner startups, including EIC-supported ventures, by connecting startups to relevant services of the Enterprise Europe Network (EEN), EU industry cluster organisations, European Digital Innovation Hubs (EDIH)[4], Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs) of the European Institute of Innovation and technology (EIT) and other EU, national, regional or local instruments.Bridge regional gaps by integrating less-connected hubs into the network via mentoring, shared services, and capacity building. Particular attention should be paid to enable deep tech spinoffs, startups and scaleups accessing resources, services and contacts not directly available in their local innovation hubs to facilitate the expansion of their operations in the single market.The selected pilot ESSHs will form a “Champions League of startup hubs”, committed to supporting each other’s startups including EIC supported ventures and Seal of Excellence holders, thus catalysing a new norm of intra-European scaling. ESSHs will serve as role model for emerging hubs in Europe and share best practices. The selected pilot ESSHs should organise one of their yearly meetings at the margins of the EIC summit and will be invited to participate actively in the yearly EIC summit meeting.The indicative project duration is two years.Selection criteria for ESSHs should include:Proven track record in startup creation, scaleup success, venture capital mobilisation, and entrepreneurial education.Strong integration of at least one local university, research and higher education institution and research and technology organisation, recognised for its research excellence in deep tech areas, in each hub represented in the consortium.Sectoral strength in deep tech areas with relevance for European strategic sectors such as, for example, artificial intelligence, quantum technologies, advanced semiconductors, medical technology, biotechnology, bioeconomy applications, cleantech and energy (including nuclear technology), water and blue tech, security, defence, space, robotics and advanced materials.Demonstrated ability to federate the relevant actors of the local innovation ecosystem (research and higher education institutions, corporates, capital providers, entrepreneurs and public authorities) and cross-border collaboration capabilities.Access to research and technology infrastructures, facilities and services, including legal and regulatory advice, and commitment to opening them to startups and scaleups from other hubs.Strong commitment and strategy on how to link up the activities of the ESSHs closely with the activities of the EIC.

This will enable more informed choices regarding the acquisition of new systems and upgrades of existing onesCompetent HPC application developers and end-users in selecting systems that best meet their needs, balancing quality factors like accuracy with considerations of cost, such as time-to-solutionOverall improved operation and fine-tuning of HPC and HPC-AI systems leading to improved performance, throughput and energy optimization, and improved end-user experienceA unified, extensible and well-documented benchmarking framework to easily accommodate new, community-contributed benchmarks with common standards, versioning and controlA well-maintained and continuously updated benchmarking suite for exascale and post-exascale HPC, incl. set of apps, as well as AI models. Scope:A. Deployment of a benchmarking framework for designing, developing and executing exascale HPC and HPC-AI benchmarks. The envisioned benchmarking framework will:offer a fine grained and fair comparison methodology among different HPC systems, i.e. all benchmarks, benchmark run rules[1] and benchmark submission rules must be designed to ensure reproducibility, repeatability and replicability of metrics on the same system, ensuring fairness and comparability of metrics across different systemsdefine precise performance metrics with a clear focus on energy-related performance indicatorsstandardise all benchmarking input- and output formatscollect and report all benchmarking results while offering statistically sound result analysesensure that all benchmarks are executable on the respective target environment(s)offer a standardized structured workflow capturing and streamlining the entire benchmarking processoffer a standardised repository with transparent version controlprovide a reference implementation for each benchmarkuse a EuroHPC reference system, where applicable, to normalize the performance metrics produced by the benchmarking suite, i.e. each benchmark is run and measured on this system to establish a reference value for that benchmark[2] subsequently, the normalized performance is the quotient of the performance value attained on the EuroHPC reference machine and the one on the system under testis of production-quality and ready to assess all EuroHPC supercomputers and supercomputers with AI capabilities,provides all required templates with relevant input data to properly execute the benchmarking suite on every EuroHPC system. The benchmarking framework along with its workflows will be realised in a software implementation that offers to the end-user a dynamic workspace for the entire workflow.B. Establishing a comprehensive exascale HPC and HPC-AI benchmarking suite utilizing the framework developed in the first objective. This benchmarking suite, with its associated performance metrics, will be designed to measure and assess the performance of HPC, as well as HPC-AI[3] systems at various levels of granularity, encompassing: Microbenchmarks: Microbenchmarks focus on small or very small building blocks of real programs. They are typically characterized by a narrow focus on a single subsystem and used by component developers or system integrators for assessing the performance and optimizing specific parts of the system, e.g. the memory subsystem, or the interconnect. Examples include: dense and sparse linear algebra operations including tensor operations, spectral methods, n-body methods, (un)structured grid methods and others.Application and workflow benchmarks: Application benchmarks are used for measuring the performance of a system under typical user inflicted workloads. Applications are comprehensive and attain a broad focus covering multiple components and their interactions. They are used by end-users, system administrators, and procurement authorities who need to evaluate overall system performance and compare different systems for their specific purposes: system selection, system optimization or system procurement. Examples are CFD, molecular dynamics simulation, numerical weather prediction, atomic scale materials modelling and others, AI model training, service/inference. Note that the concept of an application benchmarks encompasses real application benchmarks and their synthetic flavours, proxy applications, mini-apps, kernels and similar. Workflow benchmarks go beyond application benchmarks by accounting for system-performance effects of the flow and control-flow complexities of integrated scientific workflows.

The topic helps to create new or enhance existing ecosystems through activities such as networking and cooperative action, knowledge exchange and dissemination, tools, training, and policy advice.Applicants should select and clearly identify one area being addressed, choosing from the three areas outlined below. Each area is designed to contribute toward the implementation of an ERA policy: Area 1 – ERA Action “A coordinated framework responding to emerging challenges for ethics and integrity in R&I”; Area 2 – ERA Structural Policy “Enabling open science via sharing and re-use of data, including through EOSC""; Area 3 – “Green transition”, as set out in the Pact for R&I in Europe. Proposals should develop the activities outlined for the selected area as well as propose additional activities that contribute to achieving the expected outcomes.Project activities should reach large communities of stakeholders, engaging also those beyond academia, ensuring a wide geographical coverage, inclusivity, broad participation, and accessibility over the course of the project. Proposals should describe the target group in terms of its scope and size. In order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is welcomed. The involvement of entities from non-associated third countries in the consortium must be clearly explained and justified.In project activities, particular attention should be paid to promoting inclusive gender equality and addressing gender-specific challenges. Where relevant, proposals should consider the European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity[1] and the TRUST Code[2].Applicants must demonstrate in their proposal a viable plan for achieving self-sustainability after the end of the grant agreement, with a clear description of a minimum set of activities that will be maintained by the consortium with own or other resources.Expected project duration is up to 3 years without prejudice to a longer duration if justified.Area 1: Equitable, sustainable, and ethical researchExpected outcome: Proposals under Area 1 will deliver on the impact “A research ethics and integrity ecosystem continuously enhanced with robust methodologies and knowledge that encourage benefit sharing and prevent ethics dumping”, contributing to the ERA Action “A coordinated framework responding to emerging challenges for ethics and integrity in R&I”. Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:A reinforced research ethics and integrity ecosystem that supports sustainable and equitable research partnerships across lower- and high-income settings, based on the values of the TRUST Code;Enhanced expertise in benefit sharing and practical and effective methods to prevent ‘ethics dumping’;Creation of an international community of practice to promote “ethics-by-design"" in support of researchers, research participants, local communities, local/national ethics and research integrity bodies, and other key stakeholders. Scope: Area 1 promotes research ethics and integrity principles in an increasingly digitalised world to prevent breaches and address barriers to implementing ethical guidelines in the EU and beyond. The objectives are twofold: first, to reinforce an ecosystem that supports a long-lasting approach to benefit sharing, also accounting for the growing prevalence of AI; and second, to address imbalances in research, especially in high-risk or highly contingent settings, by incorporating due diligence and beneficence for research participants and local communities.Proposals should build on the results of relevant past or ongoing projects at European and/or national level[3]. Structured cooperation with the Embassy of Good Science should be included. Cooperation with university or research networks to enrich ethics-related curricula is desirable [4]. Project activities should target researchers, local/national research integrity and ethics committees, European networks of (early career) researchers and educators in research ethics, research management and integrity offices, ethics officers in research performing organisations, as well as policymakers. To achieve the expected outcomes, proposals should include the activities outlined below and propose any additional, complementary activities:Develop toolkits to facilitate partnerships that guarantee the premise of ‘do no harm’ as well as fair and just practice from conception to the implementation of actions;Develop training programmes, including a quality assurance system, for researchers and for ethics experts and committees to promote the coherence of the ethics review process;Increase awareness and disseminate knowledge of ethical values and norms for responsible R&I, including at the local level.

The AI powered robotics models developed under this Challenge are expected to comply with the EU concept for Trustworthy AI and the relevant ethical principles with due attention paid to data quality, transparency and accountability, privacy, security and safety. In the medium to longer term, it is expected to reduce European dependencies and support end users in leveraging advances in AI to enhance their products and develop new capabilities that will contribute to:Strengthened European leadership in physical AI, reducing reliance on non-European technology providers, andContribution to EU priorities in sustainability, resilience, digital transformation, and industrial competitiveness. Objective:This is a two-stage Challenge competition of which the ultimate ambition is to deliver scalable prototypes, validated in a relevant real-world environment. Solutions supported under the Challenge are expected to demonstrate both the novelty and applicability of the proposed Physical AI technology, while mitigating associated risks.Applicant to Stage 1 must also have a clear outlook on the potential longer-term impact(s).Stage1- Solution validation and benchmarking Applicants with disruptive physical AI systems that have achieved a prototype (i.e. at least TRL 4) will be invited to:Refine and validate the prototype in a relevant environment to demonstrate the core innovation (e.g., new perception (multimodal), actuation, continual learning, or autonomy capability, etc.). in the end use caseDevelop a methodology for performance assessmentAssess ethical, data governance and scalability considerationsIdentify challenges to integration such as safety, certification or scalability with view to identifying risks and exploring options for overcoming barriers for adoption including in cases where products’ risks are not covered by the AI ActConduct initial performance benchmarking, andDevelop an initial market analysis, business plan and model.

It will:Accelerate the development and validation of disruptive NAMs for biomedical applications, including medicinal products and medical technologiesSupport regulatory innovation by providing evidence-based recommendations for the assessment of safety, efficacy, and quality of human health products using NAMs.Enable citizens to benefit from novel technologies that have been assessed through rigorous NAMs that have been validated to can predict potential effects in humans, andProvide industry with a harmonised and standardised NAM-based assessment toolkit that is faster and more flexible. Objective:Specific Objectives This is a two-stage Challenge competition with the ultimate ambition to deliver robust, validated NAMs that constitute a representative model or prototype system i.e. achieve TRL 6 after Stage 2. Applicants should apply to Stage 1 only where there is an outlook of the potential impact in the longer term.Stage 1 – Solution validation and benchmarking Applicants should:Take forward preliminary engagement with regulatory authorities, notified bodies and industry stakeholdersMap regulatory, clinical, standardisation (where applicable) and industrial needs, and use this to develop a roadmap for adoptionDevelop a methodology for performance assessmentDeliver small-scale feasibility experiments or modellingConduct initial performance benchmarking (human relevance, reproducibility, transferability of the approach)Assess ethical, data governance and scalability considerations, as applicable to the given NAM under development. The following milestones need to be achieved at the end of Stage 1:Evidence that the NAM is viable for human relevant biomedical innovation, and addresses the needs of the identified use cases, andClear commitment from industrial end-users and a well-defined regulatory plan to further develop the NAM in Stage 2. Progress to Stage 2 will be contingent on delivering a full proposal which will be assessed alongside the milestones achieved under Stage 1.Stage 2 – Development and user testing Applicants selected for Stage 2 will further develop and validate a functional, scalable NAM prototype ready for regulatory, industrial, or clinical uptake. Activities must cover a number of the following elements:Benchmarking the NAMs against state-of-the-art animal models and/or human trialsDemonstration in relevant application, such as disease modelling, or testing of medicinal products and medical technologies for safety, efficacy, or qualityOrganisation of consultation meetings/workshops with industrial end users, regulators, CROs (Contract Research Organisations), standard setting bodies or other relevant stakeholders to gather further needs and feedbackEngagement with infrastructures for testing and data collection as testing and validation of the NAM outside the developer’s labDevelopment of regulatory-grade data packages suitable for submission to relevant agencies (e.g. EMA, FDA, OECD), andDocumentation on scalability, standardisation, and potential barriers to uptake. During the project’s implementation phase, beneficiaries will be encouraged to consider using the EU Reference Laboratory for alternatives to animal testing (EURL ECVAM) of the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre for aspects of standardisation, automation and validation of in vitro methods. These facilities operate and provide support at the interface between pre-normative research, regulatory sciences and innovation.Scope:New Approach Methodologies (NAMs) have the potential to replace, reduce or refine animal use in the testing96 of medicinal products. Scientific progress in recent decades has delivered several animal-free NAMs that have the potential to transform how we understand human biology and assess the safety, efficacy, and quality testing in the health sector. However, a lack of knowledge, experience and confidence in the use of such novel methodologies has limited their adoption by end users, including, for example, industry and regulators.This Challenge competition therefore looks to accelerate the adoption of NAMs in biomedicine and support companies that want to bring NAMs to the market. Applicants should propose innovative and disruptive NAMs addressing one or both of the following areas:Preclinical biomedical researchTesting of medicinal products and medical technologies for safety, efficacy, or quality. Human organoids or microphysiological systems (e.g. organ-on-chip, disease-on-chip), in chemico methods, digital twins, virtual patient simulations, AI-enhanced predictive models, mechanistic or integrated in silico platforms, 3D- advanced human tissue model are in scope.Applicants to this Challenge call should already have:Proven the viability of their proposed solution in a lab environment at TRL 4 (lab or in silico);Have letters of intent of at least one of the following stakeholders: an industrial end-user or regulatory body interested in the proposed project; andHave access to an appropriate infrastructure to carry out the planned activities in Stage 1 and 2.

It also equips them with practical skills in ethical hacking, blockchain technologies, and quantum cryptography.Robotics: the master's programme is designed to approach autonomous systems from both a computer science and an electronic engineering perspective. It covers everything from the basics of autonomous systems to such specific skills as: Internet of Things (IoT), Machine learning, Artificial intelligence, and Robotics.About the scholarshipsSPECTRO provides eligible students the financial support to take part to the education programmes and offers scholarship programmes to promote diversity in terms of gender, age, social and economic background. SPECTRO’s scholarships allow the greatest number to have access to high-quality education in digital areas and increase diversity among students and future digital experts.The students awarded a scholarship will be financially supported during their two years of studies in one of the double-degree in Masters’ programmes offered by SPECTRO.Types of scholarships availableThree types of scholarships are available:1. half tuition fee waivers which cover 50% of the tuition costs. These funding schemes are designed to reduce financial barriers and support talented students in accessing high-quality education in key digital technology domains, 2. full tuition fee waivers, covering the entire tuition cost for both years, and 3. scholarships of excellence, which include a full tuition fee waiver and a monthly living allowance adjusted according to the cost-of-living index of the host country.The 2026-2028 fees are available here: https://masterschool.eitdigital.eu/admissions/feesHow to applyTo apply to a SPECTRO scholarship, candidates must enrol into one of SPECTRO two master’s programmes. Only students enrolled and accepted in one of SPECTRO Masters’ programme are eligible to financial support.Enrolment is done via a single application portal. When enrolling to one of the two master’s programmes, applicants are given the opportunity to select 3 options as Entry University and 3 options as Exit University with order of priority. It gives students a wider choice: applicants who would not be accepted to their preferred education institution might still be accepted by another education institution.

Targeted training courses on the basis of the ECSF to improve the capacity of cyber security roles. •Applications for automated notification of private and public actors about compromised or insecure systems Objective:Where a Member State decides to participate in the European Cybersecurity Alert System, it shall designate or, where applicable, establish a National Cyber Hub, a single entity acting under the authority of the Member State.National Cyber Hubs have the capacity to act as a reference point and gateway to other public and private organisations at national level for collecting and analysing information on cyber threats and incidents and to contribute to a Cross-Border Cyber Hub. They are capable of detecting, aggregating, and analysing data and information relevant to cyber threats and incidents, such as cyber threat intelligence, by using in particular state-of-the-art technologies, and with the aim of preventing incidents.For the following programming cycle, the emphasis is on continuation of activities initiated during past years.The objective is to create or strengthen National Cyber Hubs, with state-of-the-art tools for monitoring, understanding and proactively managing cyber events, in close collaboration with relevant entities such as CSIRTs, ISACs, etc. They will also, where possible, benefit from information and feeds from other Cyber Hubs in their countries and use the aggregated data and analysis to deliver early warnings to targeted critical infrastructures on a need-to-know basis. National Cyber Hubs could also consider the possibility of monitoring undersea infrastructure, such as submarine cables.Scope:The aim is to build capacity for new or existing National Cyber Hubs, e.g. equipment, tools, data feeds, as well as costs related to data analysis, interconnection with Cross-Border Cyber Hubs, etc. This can include for example automation, analysis and correlation tools and data feeds covering Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) at various levels, ranging from field data to Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) data to higher level CTI. Automation is a key aspect in the efficient handling and processing of information. Where available, already established standards should be used, such as the Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)1 , for security advisories or for collecting and processing cybersecurity-related messages (e.g. IntelMQ project2). Applications developed by Cyber Hubs/SOCs should be compatible with European standardisation projects like the EU vulnerability database (EUVD). National Cyber Hubs should also leverage state-of-the-art technology such as artificial intelligence and dynamic learning of the threat landscape and context. This also includes the use of shared cybersecurity information, to the extent possible based on existing taxonomies and/or ontologies, and hardware to ensure the secure exchange and storage of information. The operations should be built upon live network data and other training data required in the initial phases. Where relevant, consideration should be given to SMEs as the ultimate recipients of cybersecurity operational information.A key element is the translation of advanced AI, data analytics and other relevant cybersecurity tools from research results to operational tools, and further testing and validating them in real conditions in combination with access to supercomputing facilities (e.g. to boost the correlation and detection features of cross-border platforms). Such activities are identified and proposed for financing in section 2.3, dedicated to AI for Cybersecurity, and topic 2.3.1.Furthermore, National Cyber Hubs could also consider deploying solutions for the surveillance and protection of critical undersea infrastructure, such as submarine cables, and the detection of malicious activities around them, to improve the resilience and security of this infrastructure, which is critical for global communications. The response to such hybrid threats could also include situational awareness performed through the collection and analysis of in situ, sea based sensor data as well as relevant satellite imagery. For such activities, operational synergies with the EU Copernicus Space Programme and in particular with its Security Service are required.Another key role for National Cyber Hubs is to facilitate knowledge transfer and sharing, as well as support training initiatives for all needed cybersecurity roles the basis, for instance, of the European Cybersecurity Skills Framework (ECSF3).

It will:Accelerate the development and validation of disruptive NAMs for biomedical applications, including medicinal products and medical technologiesSupport regulatory innovation by providing evidence-based recommendations for the assessment of safety, efficacy, and quality of human health products using NAMs.Enable citizens to benefit from novel technologies that have been assessed through rigorous NAMs that have been validated to can predict potential effects in humans, andProvide industry with a harmonised and standardised NAM-based assessment toolkit that is faster and more flexible. Objective:Specific Objectives This is a two-stage Challenge competition with the ultimate ambition to deliver robust, validated NAMs that constitute a representative model or prototype system i.e. achieve TRL 6 after Stage 2. Applicants should apply to Stage 1 only where there is an outlook of the potential impact in the longer term.Stage 1 – Solution validation and benchmarking Applicants should:Take forward preliminary engagement with regulatory authorities, notified bodies and industry stakeholdersMap regulatory, clinical, standardisation (where applicable) and industrial needs, and use this to develop a roadmap for adoptionDevelop a methodology for performance assessmentDeliver small-scale feasibility experiments or modellingConduct initial performance benchmarking (human relevance, reproducibility, transferability of the approach)Assess ethical, data governance and scalability considerations, as applicable to the given NAM under development. The following milestones need to be achieved at the end of Stage 1:Evidence that the NAM is viable for human relevant biomedical innovation, and addresses the needs of the identified use cases, andClear commitment from industrial end-users and a well-defined regulatory plan to further develop the NAM in Stage 2. Progress to Stage 2 will be contingent on delivering a full proposal which will be assessed alongside the milestones achieved under Stage 1.Stage 2 – Development and user testing Applicants selected for Stage 2 will further develop and validate a functional, scalable NAM prototype ready for regulatory, industrial, or clinical uptake. Activities must cover a number of the following elements:Benchmarking the NAMs against state-of-the-art animal models and/or human trialsDemonstration in relevant application, such as disease modelling, or testing of medicinal products and medical technologies for safety, efficacy, or qualityOrganisation of consultation meetings/workshops with industrial end users, regulators, CROs (Contract Research Organisations), standard setting bodies or other relevant stakeholders to gather further needs and feedbackEngagement with infrastructures for testing and data collection as testing and validation of the NAM outside the developer’s labDevelopment of regulatory-grade data packages suitable for submission to relevant agencies (e.g. EMA, FDA, OECD), andDocumentation on scalability, standardisation, and potential barriers to uptake. During the project’s implementation phase, beneficiaries will be encouraged to consider using the EU Reference Laboratory for alternatives to animal testing (EURL ECVAM) of the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre for aspects of standardisation, automation and validation of in vitro methods. These facilities operate and provide support at the interface between pre-normative research, regulatory sciences and innovation.Scope:New Approach Methodologies (NAMs) have the potential to replace, reduce or refine animal use in the testing96 of medicinal products. Scientific progress in recent decades has delivered several animal-free NAMs that have the potential to transform how we understand human biology and assess the safety, efficacy, and quality testing in the health sector. However, a lack of knowledge, experience and confidence in the use of such novel methodologies has limited their adoption by end users, including, for example, industry and regulators.This Challenge competition therefore looks to accelerate the adoption of NAMs in biomedicine and support companies that want to bring NAMs to the market. Applicants should propose innovative and disruptive NAMs addressing one or both of the following areas:Preclinical biomedical researchTesting of medicinal products and medical technologies for safety, efficacy, or quality. Human organoids or microphysiological systems (e.g. organ-on-chip, disease-on-chip), in chemico methods, digital twins, virtual patient simulations, AI-enhanced predictive models, mechanistic or integrated in silico platforms, 3D- advanced human tissue model are in scope.Applicants to this Challenge call should already have:Proven the viability of their proposed solution in a lab environment at TRL 4 (lab or in silico);Have letters of intent of at least one of the following stakeholders: an industrial end-user or regulatory body interested in the proposed project; andHave access to an appropriate infrastructure to carry out the planned activities in Stage 1 and 2.
