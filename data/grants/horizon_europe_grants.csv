The relationship between forest resilience to climate change, forest management, protection and restoration, and diverse forest ES are only partially understood, due to the limited availability of data at desired spatial and temporal scales, and the incoherent and scattered information across diverse sources. The lack of harmonised monitoring of these relationships and interactions across Europe hinders the consolidation of comprehensive knowledge that is needed for successful planning, implementation and evaluation of evidence-based policies, as well as mitigation and adaptation measures at the European and national levels.MoniFun is a Horizon Europe project that will co-create a blueprint for a system for monitoring the state and multifunctionality of Europe’s forests, which consolidates currently fragmented information (qualitative and quantitative) into a comprehensive, interoperable information system that integrates existing platforms, and is applicable to the needs of diverse stakeholders, policies, certification schemes, and society.

Forests provide a multitude of benefits to society in terms of climate regulation, raw materials, habitats for biodiversity, and many other services. Climate change is a major challenge to European forests, as demonstrated by recent heat waves, extended drought periods, and disturbances (e.g., storms, wildfires, insect outbreaks). Increased climate change may lead to shifts in tree species ranges, changes in forest productivity, and increased disturbance damage. Hence, it is important to assess to what extent adaptation measures are needed to counteract and cope with ongoing effects of climate change and forest disturbances.Climate-Smart Forestry (CSF) has been suggested as an approach to connect mitigation with adaptation measures, enhance the resilience of forest resources and ecosystem services, and meet the needs of society , . CSF has been introduced as a holistic approach to guide forest management in Europe and builds on the concept of sustainable forest management, with a strong focus on climate and ecosystem services. Two important components of CSF are to (i) increase carbon storage in forests in conjunction with other ecosystem services, and to (ii) enhance health and resilience through adaptive forest management. CSF aims to have a mix of measures by developing spatially diverse forest management strategies that acknowledge all carbon pools simultaneously to provide longer-term and larger mitigation benefits, while supporting other ecosystem services.Climate change is also an important threat to European forest biodiversity. Despite ambitious policy targets at multiple policy levels, biodiversity is under increasing threat, and degradation of ecosystems continues at an alarming rate. In the EU, the majority of forest habitat and species in protected, as well as managed forests, are in a non-favorable conservation status. As a result, there is a need to restore degraded ecosystems across the EU, including forests, and particularly those with the most potential to capture and store carbon and prevent and reduce the impact of disturbances.To guide forest practitioners on effective CSF and restoration management practices, evidence is needed on how CSF and forest restoration affect forest functioning and can support climate change mitigation, adaptation, and biodiversity in specific regional settings, including uncertainties.Crucial to the successful implementation of CSF is the coordination with citizens and stakeholders. Engaging local communities is vital to ensure that diverse perspectives and local knowledge are justly incorporated into forest management strategies. Stakeholder engagement fosters social learning, where participants can exchange knowledge,",

The documents for the call are available on the LEAP-RE website.It is highly recommended to submit the final version of the pre / full-proposal well in advance of the deadline to avoid any last-minute technical problems. Requests for extensions of the deadline due to last minute technical problems will not be considered.Evaluation procedure:A two-step evaluation procedure will apply, for the pre-proposals (step 1) and the full proposals (step 2) respectively.Evaluation stage 1: Pre-ProposalsEach eligible pre-proposals will be allocated to at least two International Review Panel (IRP) experts but most of the time three IRP experts designated according to their expertise relevant for the topic of the pre-proposal.Pre-proposals will be assessed based on the three main evaluation criteria: 1) Scientific excellence; 2) Impact and 3) Quality and efficiency of the implementation.The detailed evaluation sub-criteria are available on the call text. In case of strong disagreement between the individual scores by the IRP experts allocated to a pre-proposal (differing 6 or more points between the lowest and the highest individual total scores), the evaluation panel will have a consensus meeting to discuss and agree on the score for each of the three main evaluation criteria in the range of 0–5, resulting in a total score in the range of 0–15.A ranking list will be developed for each multi-annual roadmaps (MAR) with pre-proposals having an average or consensus score at or above 3 for all the three evaluation criteria and a total average or consensus score at or above 10.7 ranked lists (one per MAR) of pre-proposals will be produced by the IRP based on the final scores. The selection of pre-proposals for the stage 2 will be decided at a Call Steering Committee consensus meeting to finalise the stage 1 pre-proposal assessment. A list of eligible proposals of high quality will be invited to submit a full proposal for Stage 2.Evaluation stage 2: Full-ProposalsEach full proposal will be evaluated by the International Review Panel based on three main evaluation criteria listed above . The IRP will consist on at least three members, up to four members for projects of high complexity.The IRP will meet at the panel meeting to discuss all proposals, to produce an assessment report for each full proposal and to rank the lists of full proposals to be considered for funding by the funding organisations. 7 ranking lists (one per multiannual roadmap) will be established for eligible full proposals with overall score of 10 or above and with all the main evaluation criterion scores of 3 or above. Proposals not meeting the thresholds will not be recommended for funding by the IRP.All proposals will be evaluated together (i.e. the multiannual roadmaps will not be treated separately) by the",

Proposals addressing this topic should identify and develop therapies to be used in combination (combination of different antimicrobials, or combination of an antimicrobial and a non-antimicrobial that improves activity or facilitates a better targeting towards the site of infection) to reduce the development of resistance against antibacterial and antifungal treatments and extend the usability of inexpensive and readily available antimicrobials. These studies should be underpinned by scientific rationale and mechanism of action of these treatments. In the framework of this topic, improvement of existing combination treatments is eligible (i.e. pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, mode of administration). The choice of the targeted pathogens should be well justified. For the proposals having a Human Health interest, the proposed combination treatment should be directed against one of the bacterial or fungal pathogens included in the WHO priority lists.-Topic 2: Develop tools and methods to improve adherence to treatment protocols. A low adherence to the treatment protocols by end-users (patients, farmers, citizens) leads to a decreased probability of success and to an increased risk of resistance to antibacterial and antifungal treatments. Proposals addressing this topic should identify the reasons of poor adherence to treatment protocols (Human, Animal, Plant), and/or develop innovative tools (including digital tools) and methods (including sociological and behavioural approaches) to improve the adherence to treatment protocols and/or test and compare the efficiency of existing or innovative tools and methods on the adherence to treatment protocols. Engagement with end-users is mandatory. The consideration of vulnerable groups, which often have reduced access to conventional health and care services, is expected.- Topic 3: Assess the impact of antimicrobials for veterinary and agricultural use on the risk of AMR transmission to humans and the environment to inform policies on the restriction of some antimicrobials for human use. Proposals addressing this topic are expected to assess the impact of mechanisms of action, formulations, routes of administration and treatment regimens of antibacterial and antifungal drugs authorized for veterinary and agricultural use on the risk of emergence and transmission of AMR to humans and the environment. Proposals addressing this topic should also aim to improve the formulation, dosage, delivery, routes of administration and treatment regimens (including pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics) currently used in the veterinary and agricultural sector, to decrease the risk of cross-resistance, or transmission to humans and the environment. The aim is to generate evidence to support policies that restrict certain antimicrobials for exclusive human use and inform policies such as the WHO List of Medically Important Antimicrobials.Submission procedures:-The call will only support transnational research and innovation projects (more details on the composition of the consortium and on the participating funding organisations can be found on the EUP OHAMR Website-https://ohamr.eu/)-The call will follow a two-step evaluation process (submission of a pre-proposal; successful consortia will be invited to submit a full proposal).-Pre-proposals and full proposals must be written in English, and must follow the format and the guidelines provided in the pre-/full",

Understanding causes of obesity and overweight and its complications with mechanistic research1a. to investigate biological mechanisms, including chronobiological, genetic and/or epigenetic mechanisms, underlying the onset and progression of overweight and obesity, and related diseases. Secondary factors with potential influence on the biological mechanisms such as the living environment, lifestyle or psychological status should also be considered where relevant.1b. to investigate how overweight and obesity contribute to the development of related clinical complications and/or affect the mechanism of action of therapeutics against other diseases/disorders.2. Prevention and public health strategies for critical transitional periods of lifeBoth subtopics 2a. and 2b. should be addressed for critical transitional periods of life only. The choice of the critical transitional periods of life to be studied must be clearly justified in the proposal. It should be due to biological changes (e.g. postpartum, menopause, andropause), or socio-environmental changes (e.g. period in between pregnancies, diagnosis of a chronic disease, recovering from disease, retirement etc.).2a. to understand and address neglected determinants, including their interdependency, in the onset and the progression of overweight and obesity in transitional periods of life2b. to develop novel tools or preventive strategies that can be implemented against the onset and the progression of overweight and obesity in transitional periods of life taking into consideration physiological, pathophysiological, psychological behavioural influences and/or socioeconomic status of the citizens/patients.

Any unused amount from this budget will be allocated with priority to the EIC Accelerator Open call.The support will be in the form of equity-only investments managed by the EIC Fund. Applicants to this call will not receive a grant component. It provides significant financial support, and applicants should apply for an investment of a minimum of EUR 10 million and maximum of EUR 30 million, to co-invest in a funding round in the range of EUR 50 to 150 million, and at least three to five times the amount of the requested EIC contribution. The specific terms of each investment are considered and negotiated on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the EIC Fund Investment Guidelines. This ensures the investment is tailored to your company's needs while aligning with EIC's objectives. EIC STEP Scale Up is designed to fill the funding gap for companies to invest in the scale up of high-risk innovations and where the amount needed for the scale up cannot be fully financed by other investors, including InvestEU direct and indirect financial products provided by implementing partners. Applicants are encouraged to consider in particular complementarity with Venture Debt from InvestEU implementing partners in order to meet their financing needs.When implementing investments, the EIC Fund will ensure that supported companies keep most of their value, including their IP, in the EU or in the Associated Countries in order to contribute to their economic growth and job creation. Where necessary, the EIC Fund will be requested to take appropriate safeguard measures for individual companies on a case-by-case basis in order to protect European interests as defined in the Investment Guidelines.Beyond funding, your company will benefit from a strong support system that fosters your continued growth within Europe through Business Acceleration Services (details available in Section VII). Applicants to the EIC STEP Scale Up call who meet the evaluation thresholds will also be awarded a Sovereignty (STEP) Seal, to facilitate and provide possibility of the access to funding and support from other EU programmes and other funders and investors. Objective:The EIC STEP Scale Up call presents a unique opportunity for ambitious scale up companies (SMEs and small mid-caps) with game-changing innovations in Europe's critical technology areas. It offers a powerful combination of financial and strategic support designed to propel your groundbreaking solution to the forefront of these sectors.The companies selected under the EIC STEP Scale Up call shall receive investments ranging from EUR 10 to EUR 30 million. This investment can significantly accelerate the development and market launch of your technology, product, or service. With this funding, you'll gain the power to disrupt established markets and forge new ones across Europe, potentially achieving significant global impact. Crucially, this investment is designed to catalyse major funding rounds in the range of EUR 50 to 150 million, and at least 3-5 times the EIC investment. This call is part of the implementation of the Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform (STEP) which supports the development or manufacturing of critical technologies throughout the Union or safeguarding and strengthening their respective value chains. Besides, support from the EIC, the projects may be eligible for support under other EU programmes included in STEP. In 2026 support for start-ups in semiconductor technologies and quantum technologies will be pursued in particular through the STEP Scale Up call which foresees larger investments targeting strategic technologies including in support of the Chips Act. The EIC Accelerator Open call remains available in general for startups and SMEs including for quantum and semiconductor technologies.Show more Topic descriptionExpected Outcome:The EIC STEP Scale Up call offers a total indicative budget of EUR 300 million for 2026, which is expected to rise to EUR 900 million for the period 2025-2027.

The EIC Accelerator provides a unique combination of grant and investment funding and Business Acceleration Services (see Section VII of EIC Work Programme 2026).The EIC Accelerator focuses in particular on innovations building on scientific discovery or technological breakthroughs (‘deep tech’) and where significant funding is needed over a long timeframe before returns can be generated (‘patient capital’). Such innovations often struggle to attract financing because the risks and time period involved are too high. Funding and support from the EIC Accelerator is designed to enable such innovators to attract the full investment amounts needed for scale up in a shorter timeframe.The EIC Accelerator supports the later stages of technology development as well as scale up. The technology component of your innovation must therefore have been tested and validated in a laboratory and other relevant environment (e.g., at least Technology Readiness Level 5 completed). The EIC Accelerator looks to support companies where the EIC support will act as a catalyst to crowd in other investors necessary for the scale up of the innovation.Applicants to EIC Accelerator can submit proposals through:EIC Accelerator Open - which has no predefined thematic priorities and is open to proposals in any field of technology or applicationEIC Accelerator Challenges - in predefined areas of emerging and strategic technologies.

The demonstrators for innovative solutions shall have several operational differences to be covered, including:Climate: The proposed solutions shall have to be able to take into account the wide variety of European climate types. (some cases can address extreme climate events)Line type: Demonstrators shall address high speed, conventional, regional, suburban and freight lines.Traffic type: Demonstrators shall cover passenger, freight and mixed lines.Asset type: Infrastructure and rolling stock shall be addressed jointly whenever possible considering all assets, including track, civil structures, earthworks, signalling, vehicles, track side, stations or power infrastructures.Planning level: demonstrators shall cover the Strategic Asset Management Plan level (SAMP), the Asset Management Plan level (AMP) and the Implementation of the Asset Management Plan level (IAMP). The destination shall research, develop and deliver solutions that can be demonstrated by system approaches of the various developments targeting up to TRL 7/8 as European common integrated solutions. Due consideration should be given to certification and validation of the new technologies and processes as part of those demonstrators, that may be supported by several Use Cases: Asset Management & TMS. The main aim of the demonstrator shall be to show the integration between the Intelligent Asset Management System (IAMS) and the Traffic Management System (TMS) enabling the sharing of data and optimising decisions using common metrics – TRL7 by 2028.Asset Management & Rolling Stock. The main objective of this demonstrator shall be to present the monitoring of rolling stock (including on board and wayside technologies) leading to decisions and planning of interventions, and redirecting rolling stock to workshops to execute the (re)scheduled work both manually as well as by new technologies and solutions to conduct inspection tasks automatically – TRL7 by 2028.Long Term Asset Management. Development of Life Cycle Cost (LCC) models for infrastructure. This demonstrator shall include cross-border infrastructure remaining useful-life analysis and space-time cross-analysis and visualisation – TRL7 by 2028.Asset Management & Infrastructure.

This Group established in 2024 a dedicated FRMCS Deployment Subgroup to focus specifically on FRMCS future deployment activities, drawing upon insights and results from the sector plans, activities as well as EU-Rail test and demonstration initiatives.The current railway telecommunications system, GSM-R, is based on 3GPP 2G technology and is rapidly becoming obsolete. Railway telecommunications manufacturers have indicated that GSM-R networks, components, and technical support will begin to phase out from 2030 onwards. The CCS TSI 2023 sets a specific implementation rule that there is a minimum notification period of 5 years to turn off GSM-R on a specific track. In recent years, the railway sector has been actively engaged in the development of a new telecommunications system. This new system is mission-critical to ensuring the safe operation of railways. While it will continue to support current functionalities such as voice and data transmission, it will also introduce new capabilities essential for future applications. .Following the (still ongoing) development of functional and system requirements, EU-RAIL launched a test and demonstrator programme through the EU-RAIL Flagship Project FP2- MORANE2 (GA number: 101196125), which is dedicated to the execution of both lab and field testing to validate the FRMCS specifications.EU-RAIL System Pillar, will produce an updated report, with commitment of the whole Railway sector, including scope of the FRMCS specifications that will be integrated in TSI and used by the sector to procure/develop the related solutions.The EU-RAIL FRMCS deployment subgroup is tasked with addressing broader issues related to FRMCS future deployment and implementation. The urgency stems from the railway sector's view that the future availability of telecommunications presents a high-risk challenge. As a result, the sector strongly prioritizes the timely introduction of new 5G-based technology. This should be achieved within the shortest possible timeframe for upgrading existing equipment, while adhering to a European-level synchronisation strategy, taking into account both operational limitations and the individual starting positions of each Member StateThe coordination and supporting action of the project stemming from this topic shall :Provide support for the activities of the European FRMCS Deployment Group, ensuring well-organised planning, effective execution, and continuous monitoring of all actions related to deployment.More specifically, support the EU-RAIL FRMCS deployment subgroup on the : Analysis of (current) Infrastructure, rolling stock, industry and workshop capacity for (fast, easy and cost effective) deployment.

To that end, proposals under this topic should aim to deliver results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to some or all of the following expected outcomes:Foster the development and prepare for the commercialisation of innovative space-based solutions that supports an informed decision making of relevant stakeholders (e.g. energy operators, city and regional authorities, financial institutions, insurance companies, corporations, food/industrial manufacturing etc.);Leverage EGNSS-based and Copernicus-based capabilities to modernize and increase the efficiency and resilience of energy infrastructure and/or urban environment, and/or support the use of green financing schemes addressing environmental challenges as well as implementing climate resilient practices in the downstream sector;Analyse and support the consolidation of the sectorial demand for solutions based on EGNSS and Copernicus services and data, possibly also exploring the synergies with EU space based secure communication and surveillance, addressing the challenges identified in priority areas and leveraging the relevant regulatory environment. Scope:Europe has made a considerable investment in its space infrastructure, resulting in two pivotal outcomes: first, a strategic autonomy of the continent, and second, a surge in economic growth driven by space-enabled applications. Additionally, Europe boasts a thriving sector offering space data, services and products, which continues to show steady growth.The market for space data and services is fragmented, both on the side of supply and demand. A fragmented and underdeveloped demand from both public and private users does not allow for scaling up, hindering the realization of the full potential of the EU Space infrastructure.Space data can be used in almost all industry verticals in the EU and worldwide. While some sectors are already using space data to high extent, providing benefits to the citizens, economy and environment, other sectors are only marginally testing the ground. The demand creation is progressing, however, in order to foster the space data economy, it is needed to scale up and accelerate the market uptake and mass adoption of space data, in the context of the applicable legal framework.In order to achieve this, the proposals should focus on the development of innovative solutions, tailored to the specific needs of downstream industries and verticals and addressing inherent sectorial demand fragmentation issues. There is also an untapped potential of using space data to bolster green and digital transitions, presenting an opportunity to create innovative solutions in these domains.Moreover, the projects should leverage the existing relevant sectorial regulations and policies, by exploring how the proposed solutions using space data and services can support these regulations.Projects supporting the integration of EU Space data and services into vertical market segments should focus on one of the following selected priority areas (and identify which area is being addressed in the proposal):Energy (renewable energy, energy efficiency, energy infrastructure) In the face of energy supply shortages and climate change, the demand for renewable energy is rapidly increasing. Driving this demand is the fact that renewables are reducing greenhouse gas emissions and transitioning the world towards a sustainable future. Moreover, energy efficiency initiatives aim to optimize energy consumption across various sectors, from manufacturing to residential spaces, fostering a more sustainable and responsible approach to energy use. To expedite this transition, space data and services enable energy stakeholders to make informed decisions about the deployment and management of renewable energy infrastructure and to gain insights into energy consumption patterns across diverse sectors and geographic regions. Examples of downstream innovation in this context is the use of GNSS and EO technologies to enhance energy infrastructure resilience and efficiency in smart grids by adapting to real-time demand changes or to facilitate the monitoring and management of electricity distribution networks.Climate adaptation and Environmental footprint reduction: The implementation of effective Climate adaptation measures can foster climate resilience and reduce vulnerability to climate change, in communities, ecosystems and infrastructure. GNSS and EO technologies provide accurate and up to date data for assessing climate risks, prioritizing adaptation measures and allocate resources effectively to reduce environmental footprint, enabling a deeper understanding of climate change impacts and informing effective mitigation strategies. This includes the development of",

Objective:The primary objective is to establish a comprehensive technical and financial roadmap that demonstrates the potential of the quantum computer developed by the start-up for scientific innovation, economic relevance, and eventual industrial-scale deployment. In addition to the roadmap, eligible companies should deliver physical proofs of principle or preliminary prototypes that demonstrate the feasibility of their integrated hardware and software quantum computing systems. These outputs will be subject to technical assessment and a financial pre-screening, and pending a positive outcome, they will form the basis for consideration in Phase 2. The projects should showcase the added value of their quantum computing solutions in one or more carefully chosen application sectors, selected by the start-up based on technical feasibility and projected market return. As of Phase 2, the start-up should be accompanied by a number of users representative of the selected application sectors. Applicants are encouraged to include in their proposal Expressions of Interest from those user representatives.Scope:Proposals should develop an integrated technical and financial roadmap together with a benchmarking strategy. The roadmap should outline how the targeted quantum computer, combining hardware and software components, may be developed in Phase 2, ensuring a fully integrated solution.Projects should develop detailed financial viability assessments, identifying potential revenue models, commercialization pathways, and criteria for unlocking private investment during subsequent phases. Participants will receive, as appropriate to their project’s needs, tailored advisory services from the EIB Advisory, including technical and financial planning during the execution of their project in Phase 1.To ensure that Phase 1 delivers tangible outputs beyond planning documents, projects are expected to demonstrate prototypes or proofs of principle that showcase the technical feasibility of the proposed quantum computing solution in representative use cases. Standalone software-only or hardware-only approaches will not be considered. The proposal should specify appropriate performance metrics (e.g., number of physical qubits, quantum volume, gate- and readout fidelities, scalability targets, implementation of logical qubits), potential error mitigation methods and respective milestones, and the proposed methodology for validating these metrics in experimental setups at the indicated milestone date.Proposals should identify industry-relevant use cases or societal challenges that aim to address high-impact applications. Metrics such as potential computational advantages over classical computing approaches in specific tasks, improved energy efficiency, or unique problem-solving capabilities should be highlighted to support the added value in real-world adoption in the sense of quantum utility[1], without necessarily requiring claims of quantum supremacy. While references to quantum advantage metrics are encouraged where relevant, they are not mandatory at this stage. Applicants are encouraged to adopt standardized benchmarking methods (inspired by global best practices) that measure key performance indicators such as quantum volume, gate fidelity, and qubit coherence times.Proposals should include clear descriptions of how benchmarking and performance metrics will be integrated into project activities and demonstrate their relevance to both technological milestones and commercial objectives.At the end of Phase 1, the retained projects will be evaluated for potential eligibility to continue into Phase 2. The evaluation will consider the quality of technical progress, benchmarking results, feasibility and impact of the integrated hardware-software prototypes, and financial viability in alignment with investor expectations. Priority will be given to entities integrating their solutions into existing EU supercomputing centres (HPCs) to facilitate testing and deployment in high-performance computing environments. Up to 7 startups from Phase 1 will be retained for Phase 2.Financial Pre-screening: At the end of Phase 1 the Financial Pre-screening will assess the following items:Satisfactory indications of financial and commercial standing of the entity (including pre-appraisal of business description,",

Scope:Electronic Freight Transport Information (eFTI) platforms established in line with Regulation 2020/1056 will play a central role in facilitating the implementation of business-to-authority (B2A) information exchange processes related to multimodal transport of goods. In line with the Regulation’s requirements, common specifications for a single comprehensive data set and harmonised protocols for data sharing will ensure interoperability of the information shared electronically between actors, and the requirements for rights-based access-control system will establish safeguards for cybersecurity and trust. The use of electronic means to exchange regulatory information is also expected to reduce administrative costs for economic operators, to enhance the efficiency of freight transport services and to facilitate green transformation of the logistics sector.Therefore, given their potential, apart from specific B2A functionalities, eFTI platforms could also serve as an enabler for other universal, open and affordable solutions and tools to achieve digital interconnectivity of logistics systems and platforms including in a business-to-business (B2B) perspective.The proposals should unlock the potential of eFTI platforms for further functionalities, beyond the scope of Regulation 2020/1056, to new B2B services and applications as well as other B2A uses.Proposals should refer, as a core principle, to the legislative framework and specific technological solutions provided through Regulation 2020/1056, while duly reflecting the latest technological state of the art for electronic information exchange. Where relevant, and especially in B2B perspective, they should apply and build upon the concepts and solutions developed in other Union initiatives aimed to facilitate data sharing and exchange in transport, the Digital Transport and Logistics Forum (DTLF) and the European mobility data space (EMDS).Outside the scope of this topic is any type of architecture, federation of platforms or similar, as these are already delivered by eFTI and DTLF. Proposals also should not develop functionalities already required in the current scope of the eFTI Regulation. Instead, they are expected to leverage and/or extend functionalities of eFTI platforms that are in operation at the time of the implementation of the project, to ensure the effective implementation of new use cases.Building on the functionalities, requirements and implementation specifications for eFTI platforms provided for in the eFTI Regulation and its implementing and delegated acts, the proposals should address all of the following aspects:Develop technical solutions and tools, at least at the level of operational prototype demonstration (TRL7), for complementary applications and services for electronic B2A information sharing;Develop universal, open and affordable solutions and tools to enable electronic B2B information sharing in collaborative logistics processes. The proposed solutions should be implemented with minimal integration effort for industrial stakeholders, for instance through the usage of Artificial Intelligence to facilitate data and information interoperability.Develop solutions and tools to facilitate SMEs engagement in the digital freight transport and logistics ecosystem and the adoption of solutions by SMEs.Define multiple use cases, services and application of eFTI platforms for B2B and B2A processes duly accounting of relevant existing solutions and projects and identifying specific barriers to interoperability and universal adoption.Identify and define relevant data to",

Scope:CCAM-enabled vehicles are constantly sensing their surroundings on road conditions, location, nearby vehicles and infrastructure. Such data is shared in real-time, while data from other sources is received. This needs powerful and optimised large data processing algorithms, which requires large amounts of computing power, data processing, real-time operation and high levels of security. However, most existing AI computing tasks for automated vehicle applications are relying on general-purpose hardware, which has limitations in terms of power consumption, speed, accuracy, scalability, memory footprint, size and cost. Hardware advancements driven by initiatives such as the Chips JU calls must be complemented by significant efforts to optimise AI algorithms for CCAM functionalities, ensuring their efficient performance on edge-specific hardware.To encompass CCAM solutions in future steps towards e.g., the Software Defined Vehicle, this dual approach on AI advancements and hardware advancements is essential. Complementarities with projects funded under Cluster 4 “Digital Industry and Space” of Horizon Europe should also be considered where appropriate, especially in translating sector-agnostic innovations to the specificities of CCAM applications. Requirements on AI algorithm optimisation, latency, on-board energy availability, solutions to gain unbiased datasets for AI training, Electronic Control Unit (ECU) capacity and on potential safety-critical scenarios should be considered to ensure the timely triggering of actions, and in a later stage, anticipatory driving. Solutions should use, as far as possible, building blocks, interfaces, and tools from projects of the Software-Defined Vehicle of the Future (SDVoF) initiative.Edge-AI involves deploying AI algorithms on edge computing devices, which are hardware systems constrained in proximity to the data source where they operate. This is done without relying on remote resources for the computational efforts. It thus facilitates real-time insights, responses and triggering of actions, with reduced costs as the processing power close to the application is used, greatly reducing networking costs. Combining AI with edge-AI can facilitate stable solutions to include the full activity chain from sensing, perception, decision-making up to actuation of advanced CCAM solutions, gaining speed and resilience which are essential in safety-critical situations.To successfully overcome these challenges, proposed actions are expected to address all of the following aspects:For next major advancements in AI applications in CCAM solutions, huge AI applications need to fit into limited hardware, to make it fit for purpose. Edge-AI devices often have limited computational resources, making it challenging to deploy large and complex AI models. Thus, it is essential to develop and reshape approaches and building blocks for CCAM solutions, viable to be run on edge-hardware. Use cases for the approaches and building blocks should focus on time-critical applications (such as the chain from (collective) perception, decision making and actuation of functionalities) and can be linked to the activities and results from projects AI4CCAM[1] and AIthena[2].Develop optimised edge-AI algorithms and demonstrate their applicability and scalability, using real-world CCAM scenarios such as in the databases resulting from projects such as SYNERGIES[3].

Scope:The field of aircraft icing is of particular importance because it relates to the safety of flight facing adverse weather conditions, which became increasingly extreme during the last decade.The aviation industry is working to develop clean and sustainable aviation. There is the need to innovate while maintaining safety.To enable design, validation and future certification of new technologies emerging from cleaner aviation, R&I should be initiated on the following three principal areas ( proposals should consider addressing all, or significant areas of all, three areas):1. R&I to prepare for the development of means of compliance for certification of future sustainable aviation concepts including:Development of reliable numerical tools to be used to validate the designs against the icing environment of Appendix C, O, P and snow, including ground anti-icing fluids;Development of Supercooled Large Drop (SLD) Testing Capabilities such as icing wind tunnel test or ice tankers. Generation of flight-testing open datasets for validation of modelling and tunnel testing;Development of European Ice Crystal test Capability (for engine/air data probe);Development of Falling / Blowing Snow Testing Capability. 2. R&I on Icing environment to assess the impact of the climate change effects on the certification icing environments[1].3. R&I related to new technologies for Ice detection and protection, including:Ice crystal and SLDs Ice Detection systems to optimise Ice crystals protection or support the detect and exit the SLD appendix O or a portion of the appendix O conditions;High Efficiency/Low Energy protection: cleaner aviation with more electric airplanes will drive the need for new ice protection technology: more effective and with less energy, active, passive and hybrid technologies (e.g., low ice-adhesion durable coatings and including new air mobility products (e.g., low speed propeller icing concerns);Dissimilar means for Air data (angle of attack (AOA)/Speed) measurement and insensitive to icing threat. Air speed and aircraft attitude measurements are crucial for aircraft control. Air data/navigation probes are externally mounted and exposed to adverse conditions. Dissimilar means to determine the aircraft speed and altitude would provide benefits and make the air data system even more robust and fault tolerant to environmental conditions (icing or hail);Enhanced aircraft performance and in particular ice protection health monitoring by improving the ice protection system monitoring coverage based on smart systems capable to monitor a large number of aircraft parameters.

Scope:The initial deployment of Level 4 automated vehicle services in urban and other complex settings has encountered significant challenges in environmental perception and decision-making, leading to occasional remote assistance calls, blockages and accidents that have impacted public trust. At the same time, the increasing computing power demand is in conflict with a limited usage of energy and resources to meet sustainability requirements. Thus, emerging large-scale demonstrations of automated vehicles should be accompanied by objective-oriented research aimed at addressing these challenges directly, while targeting improvements in performance, accuracy, reliability, and cyber-security.To successfully overcome these challenges, proposed actions for this topic are expected to address all of the following aspects:Advancements in all steps of the sense-control-act process for both vehicle- and infrastructure-based smart sensor systems and networks, controllers, and actuators to ensure safety and trustworthiness of CCAM, as well as facilitating effective disruption management;Utilisation of digital enabling technologies including, for example: AI at-the-edge, machine learning, data spaces with reference scenarios and suitable software architectures[1];Adoption of modular, reusable, and open software platforms supporting the environment perception for CCAM while ensuring transparency of operation, verification, and safety assessment to build trust, with respect to authorities, decision makers and the public via direct performance explainability;Energy efficiency, circularity, and eco-design of the environment perception systems by decreasing potential energy and resource consumption in both production and operation as well as facilitating reusability, reparability and upgradability while further enhancing the performance;Reduction of potential costs of environment perception systems through scalability, modularity and standardisation, making technologies financially viable for widespread implementation;Support remote assistance as a stepping-stone towards higher levels of autonomy and vehicle automation in wider Operational Design Domains (ODD). Solutions are expected to integrate electronic hardware architectures and software stacks in a co-design approach. Hence, it is strongly encouraged that solutions use, as far as possible, building blocks and tools from projects of the Software-Defined Vehicle of the Future (SDVoF) initiative under the Chips Joint Undertaking, e.g., on the hardware abstraction layer and SDV middleware and API framework. Results from projects funded under HORIZON-CL5-2024-D6-01-04[2] and complementarities with projects funded under Horizon Europe Cluster 4 “Digital Industry and Space” should also be considered, where appropriate.As the activities should demonstrate feasibility and their full potential for real-world applications, proposals should foresee exchanges with other relevant EU or national projects for e.g., coordinated validation, transport systems integration and large-scale piloting. Collaboration should also be sought with projects funded under HORIZON-CL5-2024-D6-01-01[3] and other directly relevant call topics.In view of the relevance of environment perception and decision-making of automated vehicles for the responsiveness of the innovation to diverse societal interests and concerns, accessibility, inclusiveness as well as regulation, proposals should consider societal, ethical, socio-economical and/ or legal aspects as far as feasible in the requirements of the technical solutions to be developed. This could involve the engagement of institutional users as well as citizen-science approaches, e.g., in collaboration with projects CulturalRoad[4] and Diversify – CCAM[5].To achieve the expected",

Scope:This topic aims to reduce development costs and time to market of new battery systems by accelerated multi-physical and virtual testing. Current test strategies are still very time consuming and costly due to the need to understand the impact of multi-physical operational loads (electric, thermal, mechanical, etc.), potential failure modes, ageing and misuse on the safety and reliability of battery cells and modules.To overcome these barriers, new multi-physical test strategies supplemented by virtual testing are required taking into account the most impactful parameters on ageing, reliability and safety and their dependencies.Proposals are expected to address Electric Vehicle (EV) batteries and are encouraged to develop techniques and methodologies which are applicable to other forms of electro-mobility as well as stationary applications (including second life).Proposals are expected to address and demonstrate all the following activities:Understand and describe the impact of multi-physical operational loads, failure modes, ageing and misuse on battery reliability and safety highlighting the dependencies between them in order to design the most adequate testing methods and parameters;Derive advanced operating profiles for testing and development of novel X-in-the-Loop (XiL) test environments for multi-physical and accelerated testing addressing electrical, thermal and mechanical loads at the same time;Combine physics-based with data-driven test strategies enabling reliable virtual and physical battery testing considering specific applications;Develop simplified test strategies reducing the number of tests and their complexity while improving battery safety and reliability. Synergies between different battery chemistries, including next generation battery designs and sizes must be exploited where possible, allowing to re-use or scale test results from cell to system level;Research activities are also expected to lead to advanced response strategies for damaged and aged batteries. Furthermore, a contribution to the European safety classification system is expected by developing standards for this safety classification. To this end, proposals are expected to establish contact and exploit complementarities with selected proposals under topic HORIZON-CL5-2025-04-D5-03 “Safe post-crash management of road Light Duty Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) (2ZERO Partnership)” with regards to monitoring techniques for safety risks, algorithms for defining state of health and remaining useful life. Activities covering the following aspects are encouraged:Development of virtual methods for full system validation using physical sub-system results;Development, exploitation, and harmonisation of advanced battery cell or pack measurement and diagnostic methods for enhancing the data depth and breadth over what is currently available. Definition of performance indicators relating to battery degradation and safety, and development of methods for the validation of digital models.Application of AI and generative AI for the definition of the design of experimental and testing strategies to increase the outcome of experimental testing campaigns, in order to accelerate achievement of significant conclusions, and to thus reduce testing time and effort. Whenever the expected exploitation of project results entails developing, creating, manufacturing and marketing a product or process, or in creating and providing a service, the plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results must include a strategy for such exploitation. The exploitation plans are expected to include preliminary plans for scalability, commercialisation, and deployment (feasibility study, business plan) indicating the possible funding sources to be potentially used (in particular the Innovation Fund).Proposals are expected to also establish cooperation and complementarity with the selected proposal under the topic HORIZON-CL5-2023-D2-02-03: “Creating a digital passport to track battery materials, optimise battery performance and life, validate recycling, and promote a new business model based on data sharing (Batt4EU Partnership)” with regards to safety and ageing information as part of the battery passport.Proposals could consider the involvement of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC)[1] whose contribution could consist of performing experimental or desk-top research on battery performance and/or safety.

Scope:Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from transport represent around 25% of total man-made GHG emissions and continue to grow. The negative impact of these is further strengthened by the existence of other external costs of transport, including air pollution, noise, congestion and accidents. The EU, Member States and industry have made considerable efforts to reduce transport-related GHG emissions and associated external costs.Accurate and reliable information on emissions is an important tool to increase effectiveness of specific emission reduction measures undertaken by public authorities and businesses. Over the past 15 years, a lot of progress has been made at EU level and globally through new regulatory actions and continuing collaboration between actors to improve the transparency of transport GHG emissions and external costs monitoring. This is manifested through:Regulatory initiatives including Regulation (EU) 2023/1805 (FuelEU Maritime)[1], Regulation (EU) 2023/2405 (ReFuelEU Aviation)[2], Regulation (EU) 2015/757 (EU MRV)[6] and especially, the recent Commission’s proposal for the Regulation on the accounting of greenhouse gas emissions of transport services (CountEmissions EU)[3], and Directive (EU) 2023/2413 (Renewable Energy Directive);Relevant EU research projects, including “Carbon Footprint of Freight Transport” (COFRET), “Logistics Emissions Accounting & Reduction Network” (LEARN) and the on-going “Creating Legitimate Emission Factors for Verified GHG Emission Reductions in Transport” (CLEVER)[8];Standardisation work, including ISO 14083, the official international standard developed between November 2019 and October 2022 and published in March 2023 as part of the 14000 family of ISO GHG-related standards[9];Regular updates of the Handbook on the External Costs of Transport[10];Industry initiatives, such as the Global Logistics Emissions Council (GLEC) Framework, the industry-led guideline for GHG calculation and reporting in the global logistics sector. Building on the initiatives listed above, proposals should undertake further work to ensure that:The full climate impact of transport operations is covered in a comprehensive and consistent way;Relevant open items identified in the emissions accounting reference methodology set out under the Commission’s proposal on CountEmissions EU can be scientifically clarified and closed;Any detailed tweaks to the methodology that have come to light through application can be developed and tested in view of the implementation of the CountEmissions EU framework;New technologies, such as generative Artificial Intelligence, are considered in developing datasets and methodologies;Relevant data is available for the proper implementation and seamless integration of requirements set in other EU climate related legislation in transport, including Regulations on Fuel EU Maritime, ReFuelEU Aviation, EU MRV, and Regulation (EU) 2020/1056 on electronic freight transport information[11]. The Action will play a central role in contributing to the establishment of an unambiguous scientific framework aimed to tackle emissions in transport. However, the Action should also facilitate alignment between EU policy development and market implementation, especially towards enabling market-based accounting approaches that would support proactive investment in low emission fuels and associated transport services. The proposals should address all of the following aspects:Explore, assess and establish the state of the art regarding issues of measuring and calculating specific types of transport-related emissions for which there is no clear consensus on the market, in particular: black carbon emissions, which primarily result from the combustion of fossil fuels in compression ignition engines; radiative forcing, which has been suggested as having a strong supplementary climate impact at high altitude and is already included in an inconsistent manner across some, but not all, transport GHG reporting programs; GHG emissions from vehicle manufacturing and scrappage, which, although not directly linked to transport operations, do contribute to overall life cycle transport emissions; GHG emissions that result from the installation of transport infrastructure, which would need to include the definition of rules for the combination of operational and life cycle emission calculations into a",

Scope:The scope covers quasi-solid and all-solid-state lithium-ion battery technologies (up to 5% liquid electrolyte weight percentage) which encompasses Si-C composite anodes or lithium metal anodes.Process-Specific Machinery and Technological UpgradesProjects are expected to identify and target at least one key manufacturing process for enhancement, and to focus on optimising and testing the specific critical process(es) within existing production lines rather than overhauling the entire production system. These processes must be critical to the transition from liquid electrolyte to solid-state batteries and have the potential for high-impact improvements in terms of production yield, quality, cost, and sustainability including energy consumption.Projects are expected to cover all of the following tasks:Provide detailed plans on how existing machinery and systems can be adapted to optimise the chosen process, ensuring that these enhancements are both impactful and economically viable;Modify existing machinery to better support the specialised requirements of the targeted process. This includes enhancing capabilities to handle new materials and designs efficiently;Develop and implement technological innovations that specifically enhance the chosen process, such as precision manufacturing tools and additive manufacturing. Feasibility and Impact ValidationProjects are expected to conduct pilot testing to validate the feasibility and benefits of the enhancements on the chosen process. Proposals are expected to include clear metrics for evaluating improvements, such as reductions in energy consumption, increases in production yield, and enhancements in product consistency.Projects are encouraged to evaluate the impact of the new or improved process on other steps in the manufacturing line, including any necessary modifications to adjacent processes, or across other parts of the production line and in different manufacturing environments.Advanced Materials and Cell Design IntegrationProjects are expected to tailor the design of the produced cell to maximise the benefits of the improved process. This can be done through the development of new advanced materials or through the integration of existing materials to improve the targeted manufacturing process.Digitalisation, Data Integration and Analytics and Process ControlProjects are expected to cover at least one of the following tasks:Implement advanced control systems and digital technologies that are specifically designed to optimise the chosen process, improving efficiency, and reducing waste;Develop new process simulation methods, process models and materials chemistry models allowing to virtually assess novel cell designs’ flexible manufacturability at scale for adapted existing plants.

Scope:The share of trips made by active modes is increasing, which is in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. This increase is linked to cities actively placing more focus on the mobility and safety needs of pedestrians, cyclists, e-cyclists and users of other micro-mobility device, which materialises in new regulations, and in new or improved infrastructure. However, pedestrians and cyclists remain heavily affected by crashes. Concurrently, the use of electrically assisted devices (such as e-bikes, e-scooters, e-cargo bikes, mobility systems used by people with disabilities, etc.) – to be referred to as micromobility modes – is increasing exponentially because these modes represent an efficient means of personal mobility, as well as a new and effective mode for the last-mile delivery of goods within the city area. Micromobility modes, shared and owned, have been adopted by commuters, tourists, the elderly, food and goods delivery companies, and come in varying sizes and operating speeds. When their use emerged, micromobility modes were associated with high hospitalisation rates, mainly for the micromobility users themselves, but also pedestrians and cyclists. While efforts have been made to regularise and standardise these vehicles, especially in the case of shared e-scooters, there is still a significant knowledge gap related to the operational safety of these vehicles in cities.Proposals submitted under this topic should address all of the following aspects:Collect and use exposure data when analysing the safety of pedestrians, cyclists, and micromobility users, and identify crash contributing factors and their interactions;Provide an extensive analysis of the safety needs, as well as tailored safety measures for cyclists and each type of micromobility mode (e.g. shared e-scooters versus owned e-bikes), while taking into account the trip purpose (e.g. recreational ride versus delivery of goods), and the socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of the users;Assess the actual and perceived safety risk of pedestrians and cyclists due to the emergence of micromobility modes that operate at higher speeds and that have increased in size and weight;Quantify the impact of the geometric design, quality, and continuity of the cycling infrastructure on the safety of cyclists, pedestrians and micromobility users, considering their increasing demand, operating speeds, and size of vehicles;Assess the potential effectiveness of vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technologies in decreasing conflicts and near misses between pedestrians, cyclists and micromobility vehicles, and users and motorised vehicles;Identify best practices in the design of bicycles and micromobility vehicles in terms of stability and the avoidance of single crashes, contributing to the underlying development of a",

the Smart and Sustainable Mobility Strategy as well as the implementation of the Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission, project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:Real-time demonstration of on-board tamper-proof and remote measurement techniques for a wide range of pollutants (including pollutants from alternative fuels and non-regulated pollutants) from vessel emissions, allowing shipowners to measure the emissions during operation and contributing to the current monitoring and enforcing activities of public authorities, such as port and maritime authorities and with the potential to be used for future compliance monitoring;Development of broadly accepted harmonised methods to measure real sailing emissions, including coastal, open seas and inland waterway with potential to be used for future compliance monitoring;Development of an automatic reporting and verification system solution that helps shipping companies to comply with current and future regulation and for maritime, inland and port authorities to monitor and control the actual ship emissions derived from the data exchanged;Contribution to the delivery of better emission factors for emissions inventories and projections, especially for harmful substances and fuel mixtures for which little knowledge exists today and ultimately contributing to the establishment of a broadly accepted method for measuring and calculating real sailing emissions of a ship;Identification of real-world releases of harmful substances which are currently not controlled by regulations and excessive releases of substances already controlled in open seas and in-port activities;Innovative technologies and systems to monitor, measure and identify the source of pollution in ports beyond vessels, including other transport modes, port operations and industries active in the port environment are made available for public authorities;Recommendations for improved certification and testing to better cover real world situations;Support of local, regional, national and international emissions reduction and air quality plans and noise action plans by providing real-world emission information and measuring the actual impact of control measures and strategies on concentrations and/or deposition of pollutants;Identification of risk areas for potential violations to emission limits. Scope:There is a pressing need to measure accurately the different types of emissions in coastal and port environments located near to cities, because of their negative impact on the environment and human health. Ports, as intricate environments showcasing a variety of vessels including novel designs, pose a challenge to the development of standardised technologies capable of collecting and assessing real-time pollutant emissions data from these ships docking at ports. This is vital for enforcing emissions limits and validating the data for enforcement purposes.Moreover, emissions in ports stem from other sources, such as port operations (e.g., cargo handling, towing, fuel storage, and bunkering) or even other industrial activities (directly or indirectly linked to transport, e.g., fisheries) taking place within the port area. Additionally, ports are frequently situated near industrial zones, making it crucial to possess an accurate and, where possible, real-time understanding of the types, origins, and intensity of pollutant and noise emissions generated in and around a port area.The shift from heavy fuel oils to alternative fuels in the context of the regulatory framework[1] set to achieve the objectives of the Green Deal requires further research actions; recent evidence from research and monitoring projects has shown that new fuels being considered and GHG emission-control technologies used on-board vessels may result in emissions of other harmful pollutants that are not sufficiently controlled. In some cases, unexpected side effects of emission abatement may arise which might require regulatory action[2].Further to such undesired releases, it is crucial to ensure that vessels comply with regulations in force, in coastal areas, at open sea and in inland waterways. Projects under call LC-MG-1-1-2018 of Horizon 2020 showed that remote measurement of SOx emissions using stationary or mobile techniques can significantly increase the cost-effectiveness of compliance monitoring. It is important to explore whether remote or on-board techniques can be extended to the monitoring of additional pollutants such as CH4, NOx, N2O, NH3, UFP, BC, formaldehyde, PM[3], as well as the Particle Number (PN), NPAHs and to provide internationally harmonised methods and reporting procedures where such measurements can be used within an enhanced compliance monitoring framework in the future. These methods should also",

Scope:Data sharing plays a pivotal role in supporting R&I, enabling deployment, and enhancing the competitiveness of the CCAM industry. Within the realm of data sharing, there are two distinct categories of data that are particularly pertinent: mobility data, and data for research and development. The common European mobility data space[1] aims to facilitate mobility data access and sharing, and is supported by projects, notably from the Digital Europe Programme. This mobility data space will facilitate the sharing of data related to mobility patterns, traffic flow, and other macroscopic aspects that are essential for the development of CCAM solutions. Within the research, testing and deployment of CCAM solutions for the automotive as well as infrastructure sectors, there is a need for a dedicated data space tailored specifically to the requirements of CCAM stakeholders. This CCAM Data Space demands a more granular and extensive array of data to cater to the needs of both Tier X suppliers, Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), traffic managers and infrastructure providers, particularly in terms of vehicle and traffic safety considerations. Specific aspects related to ongoing regulatory developments would need to be considered (e.g. Automated Driving Systems and General Safety regulations, adaption of type approval to the AI Act, including trustworthy AI integration).Several data spaces exist or are being developed in Europe for CCAM in specific R&I initiatives. The FAME[2] project has released a CCAM Data Sharing Framework (DSF) 2.0 describing best practices in data sharing and will develop a CCAM Federated Data Space as a proof of concept to facilitate the exchange of research and test data across R&I projects. Several CCAM Partnership R&I projects expressed interest in making data available and reusing data from other projects through the FAME Test Data Space, once it will be operational. The scenario-based validation approach for safety argumentation in highly automated functions will result in an integration of various scenario databases facilitated by a federated layer, as developed in project SUNRISE[3] and SYNERGIES[4]. However, this integration falls short of constituting a comprehensive Data Space approach, both for new data sets and extensions of existing datasets. To achieve full Data Space functionality for CCAM, significant enhancements are required in terms of developing connectors, APIs, and protocols for seamless data exchange. Additionally, there is a need to refine user profile management systems and establish robust contractual frameworks to govern data access and usage rights. A generic data space blueprint and building blocks are being developed and governed by the Data Space Support Centre[5]. In parallel, the DeployEMDS[6] builds a decentralised technical infrastructure and common governance mechanisms for urban mobility use cases in 9 cities and regions across Europe.Consequently, substantial efforts are necessary to fully integrate these approaches into a cohesive and efficient Data Space environment that can effectively support the diverse needs of the CCAM research community and industry. Moreover, extensive datasets are also indispensable for the development of low-level modules such as driver monitoring systems, perception systems, and decision-making algorithms, as well as for sensors like GNSS, radar, cameras, and lidar. While projects like AIthena[7] and AWARE2ALL[8] have generated valuable datasets, the lack of centralised storage and access hampers their utility. Therefore, there is a strong need to incorporate such datasets into a unified CCAM Data Space that is aligned with the data space blueprint, taking advantage of the common building blocks. By",

The project is expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:The European Commission has a comprehensive overview on the way Societal Readiness is addressed and integrated in piloted projects, and main challenges and concerns are identified;A proven strategy to intensify collaboration between STEM[1] and SSH[2] partners led to in-depth interdisciplinary work in R&I projects. All involved project constituencies and relevant parts of society are accounted for in an integrated way to ensure broad and sustainable support for R&I solutions;The next generation of Societal Readiness projects benefits from current pilot projects’ experiences, success stories and do’s and don’ts thanks to a public web platform, acting as a one-stop-shop for Societal Readiness for future EU projects;The European Commission is equipped with a sound, clear, and replicable procedure – both at implementation and content level – presented as an improvement of the current approach, to address Societal Readiness effectively in future EU funded R&I projects. Scope:The European Commission has a strong interest in learning from the implementation of Societal Readiness actions piloted in eight topics from the Cluster 5 work programme 2025[3], and resulting in an estimate of eighteen projects to be implemented. Conclusions on the pilot’s monitoring and evaluation will be the basis for the European Commission’s decision to replicate further these actions, to improve its implementation and possibly widen its use to other fields of application.The instructions and definitions applying to pilot topics are included in the introduction of the Horizon Europe Main Work Programme 2025 for Climate, Energy and Mobility.The action is expected to analyse the way Societal Readiness is addressed and integrated in piloted projects and help in designing an efficient, clear, and impactful way of applying a Societal Readiness approach in future EU funded R&I projects with a true interdisciplinary collaboration.The project selected should address all of the following actions:Make a consolidated analysis: on the way Societal Readiness is considered and integrated in the Descriptions of the Actions[4] of selected pilot-projects in terms of content (e.g., the type of Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) guiding questions chosen and related methodology), implementation (e.g., SR related work distribution and partners) and methodology. Assess the level, timing, and quality of interactions between SSH and STEM partners during the proposal preparation.of all First reports on Societal Readiness to be delivered by the selected pilot-projects. Assess the way SR consideration unfolds from the Description of the Actions’ methodology, observe how guiding questions are addressed and plan to respond to the concerns identified. Compare the various ‘SR visions’ put forward by each consortium.of all Final reports on Societal Readiness to be delivered by the selected pilot-projects. Assess the various projects’ experiences, challenges and lessons learned during the actual implementation of the Societal Readiness activities, looking at the participation and type of external actors in co-design methods, responses to SR guiding questions, possible adjustment of R&I activities. Mid-project recommendations based on the two first points are expected in order to give a preliminary sense of directionality for future Societal Readiness projects.Analyse the various interdisciplinarity mechanisms (SSH vs. STEM, collaboration with societal stakeholders) across pilot-projects as well as their effectiveness in practice. Identify successful interdisciplinary approaches and less successful ones. Possible evolutions in partners behaviours, or changes in interdisciplinary strategies should be identified. The degree of involvement from partners in SR activities, as well as the way they perceive them (in a positive or negative way) should also be scrutinised. This analysis should result in a publication with concrete tips helping future project partners integrating implementable, efficient, and well-accepted interdisciplinary practices both within consortia and towards external actors.Organise annual workshops in physical format to allow all pilot project representatives to meet, interact and exchange experiences periodically. Travel costs for all participants are to be covered by this action.Set up a public web platform during the action duration, to provide a direct source of support to future SR users, including examples of SR pathways, do’s and don’ts, tips and tricks specifically tailored to facilitate the use and understanding of",

Application of such human behavioural models in the virtual safety validation of CCAM systems to realistically represent the behaviour of human-driven vehicles in closed loop simulations of mixed traffic, thereby reflecting the variety of human driving behaviour, including behaviour in complex real-world and emergency conditions. Scope:The deployment of CCAM systems in mixed traffic will mean intense interaction with all road users such as the human drivers of other vehicles as well as pedestrians and riders of two-wheelers. These interactions (including implicit and explicit communication by humans and CCAM systems) will play a crucial role in the acceptance and thereby the penetration of CCAM systems in future road transport. CCAM systems will have to show safe and human-like driving behaviour, so that their decisions and actions can be anticipated easily by all road users, respecting the variety of typical driving behaviour across different countries as well as the need for CCAM systems to respect traffic rules and support road safety.This will require validated models of explicit and implicit human driving behaviour to design and validate such system behaviour. These models will be needed in closed loop simulations of CCAM systems in mixed traffic to realistically represent the reactions of human drivers in other vehicles to the behaviour of a CCAM system. Models representing human driving behaviour are being developed by the projects i4Driving[1] and BERTHA[2] for selected fields of application, i.e. they will be calibrated for a limited number of scenarios. Bringing together and building upon the results of these projects – in particular a simulation library and an innovative methodology to account for uncertainty from i4Driving and a scalable, probabilistic driver behavioural model from BERTHA, research is needed to extend the fields of application that these projects are addressing with a focus on representing driver behaviour in a multitude of safety-critical scenarios, considering the variation and statistical distribution of human behavioural patterns and the factors influencing such behaviour, including the parallel execution of non-driving related tasks.To achieve high degrees of robustness and applicability in a wide range of scenarios, detailed calibration and parameterisation is necessary, as driver behaviour depends on factors such as the road infrastructure, vehicle types, traffic conditions and rules, as well as regional influences and driver experiences / demographics, e.g., gender, age and other relevant social variables. Considering the deviation of average from ideal human driving behaviour, proposed actions must also validate the models for their extended fields of application, going well beyond the applications and degrees of validation accomplished by the above-mentioned projects under HORIZON-CL5-2022-D6-01-03. Proposed actions are thus expected to raise the technology readiness of such models to TRL 5. Data for parameterisation and validation should be captured by monitoring real human drivers in driving simulators and/or real traffic considering what is happening inside and outside the vehicle.Proposed actions should integrate, to the extent possible, the validated models in the virtual validation and verification approaches as developed in the projects HEADSTART[3] and SUNRISE[4] and complemented by the project SYNERGIES[5]. Successful integration should be demonstrated in various safety-relevant scenarios as provided by the action(s) funded under HORIZON-CL5-2023-D6-01-02[6]. Models should be shared via the federated data exchange platform for CCAM to be developed by an action under HORIZON-CL5-2025-D6-06[7].Proposals are encouraged to also explore additional fields of application of validated driver behaviour models, while the integration of relevant expertise from social sciences and humanities (SSH) is expected.To achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is encouraged with research stakeholders in Japan and the United States but also with other relevant strategic partners in third countries. Such cooperation should exploit synergies as far as possible in capturing data for",

Scope:One of the principles of the Safe System Approach is to turn from mainly re-active to pro-active management of road safety, i.e. not to derive needs for intervention primarily from crash investigations, but to intervene before serious crashes happen. The ubiquitous gathering of ever-growing amounts of data and their processing in the digital transport system support this idea providing valuable information on traffic situations and events. Potential data sources include amongst others: smart phones, wearables, connected vehicles, drones, road-side sensors (e.g. camera, radar), etc. Progress in computing power, in the accuracy of location services and in video analytics are further enablers in the processing and analysis of such data in order to identify safety-critical situations or conflicts based on surrogate safety metrics.In terms of crash prediction modelling artificial intelligence has the potential to identify the underlying risk and the complex relationships between large and diverse datasets which in turn could lead to the identification of crash contributing factors and their interrelations. The identification of these risk factors may then allow predicting safety-critical situations at quantifiable risk levels and guide the proactive implementation of crash avoidance measures, as proposed amongst others by the International Transport Forum at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Ideally, interventions would be feasible in real-time and increase the safety of all road users.Proposals should address all the following aspects:Development of an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled digital twin of traffic and infrastructure. This would integrate historical, current, and forecast data, including crowdsourcing and infrastructure sensors, infrastructure topology and condition, along with environmental (e.g. local weather and visibility) and road and traffic conditions. Such a digital twin can allow monitoring and preventively optimising both safety and traffic flow, equally addressing congestion and resilience issues. Results from existing projects like OMICRON[1] could be considered. The proposals should also explore the possibility and usefulness of other type of data such as sociodemographic and economic data, behavioural driving data, data from security cameras, among others that could be provided by third parties (tourism, planned events, demand, etc.);Analyse in detail the technical challenges associated with the acquisition and use of adequate and reliable big data from multiple sensors in the road transport system, as well as the process of combining these datasets in ways that are meaningful for proactive road safety analysis;Develop methods and tools to predict safety-critical traffic situations at quantifiable risk levels based on real-time and historical data;Account for biases in the datasets and ensure that the developed AI-based models or algorithms are bias-free, so that the safety of all road users will be improved effectively in a fair, non-discriminatory way;Analyse in detail also the non-technical challenges associated with this approach and the inherent need to collect and share large amounts of data that can be used to identify and quantify road safety-related risk factors. Ethical, legal and economic issues should be considered and concepts be developed to overcome these challenges in terms of privacy concerns, questions of data ownership, organisational barriers etc;Analyse what real-time countermeasures can be taken to reduce instantaneous risk levels for all road users complementary to existing Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) services;Demonstrate the feasibility of such risk predictions and targeted interventions;Build consensus among relevant stakeholders on possible routes for deployment in coordination with other ITS services. Particular attention should be dedicated on establishing interoperability standards for data sharing, through the implementation of the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles and leveraging on already adopted practices especially those in the relevant Common European data spaces.Ways to leverage valuable complementary data, e.g. metadata from crash",

Scope:The overarching policy background is the European Grean Deal, which aims to achieve climate neutrality by 2050. In the transport area, this translates into a 90% reduction of transport-related greenhouse gas emissions by 2050[1]. To deliver the European Green Deal, there is a need to revise and upgrade numerous policies, including those for transport and large-scale infrastructures.The EU Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy[2] (SSMS), which translates this overall transport target into actions, states that infrastructure must be adapted to climate change and made resilient to disasters. In line with the SSMS, it is also important that such infrastructure should rely on clean and decarbonised energy sources, notably renewable energy, as well as on a modernised grid.Research in this topic should provide knowledge and technical solutions to a triple challenge: (1) limiting emissions of transport infrastructures; (2) making them more resilient to climate change; and (3) addressing environmental and biodiversity aspects. Projects should cover the entire life cycle of transport infrastructures, covering overall emissions from sourcing of materials, construction, maintenance, operation and decommissioning of the infrastructure.Proposals should address all of the following aspects:Development of new methods and techniques to construct, manage, maintain and repair (including self-repair) transport infrastructures, in order to increase climate resilience and lower emissions;Assessment of solutions considering the principles of circularity and taking into account the entire life cycle assessment (LCA) approach;Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) of the solutions considering the entire life cycle of the infrastructure and accompanying business plans for their implementation;Application of innovative materials (e.g. green asphalt, green cement, carbon sinks) that enable transport infrastructures to become more resilient, more sustainable and emit less pollutants;Validation of all the proposed solutions and proofs of concepts is to be carried out in at least two large-scale demonstrations. The demonstrations should cover at least two different transport infrastructure types (e.g., road, rail, waterborne, airport) which are located on at least two different Trans European Transport Network (TEN-T) corridors. The demonstrations should also cover different environments and phases of the infrastructure life cycle (e.g. design, construction, maintenance, decommissioning);Analysis of EU national and international standards in construction, inspection, maintenance and deconstruction, contributing to the decarbonisation and increased resilience of transport infrastructure;Design of green, sustainable and innovative public procurement methods, contributing to lowering the environmental footprint, resources, and material consumption;Demonstration of sustainable and climate resilient infrastructure with nature-based solutions (NBS[3]), minimising the negative effects on the environment, including the degradation of ecosystems, the fragmentation of habitats and the loss of biodiversity. The projects should develop clear indicators with baselines and quantified targets in support of the expected outcomes that are monitored for each demonstration site. With regards to the expected outcomes, projects should take into account expected technological developments and policy implementation (e.g. revised TEN-T regulation), multi-disciplinary adaptive capacity in line with the European Climate Risk Assessment[4] (EUCRA) and the Commission Communication on Managing Climate Risks[5], in particular cascading impacts across sectors.Proposals should consider and build on results from previous calls on resilient and sustainable infrastructure and standards,[6] and should incorporate relevant EU guidance on the development and management of European transport infrastructures. Proposals should also build on previous results from projects on advanced materials, sensor technology, digitalisation, asset management, decision support and automation in the construction and maintenance of infrastructures.

Scope:While the increased use of sustainable transport modes and multimodal solutions are critical levers for transport, logistics and supply chain decarbonisation, and despite obvious environmental advantages, the modal share of the EU IWT sector has remained below expectations over the last decades. The seamless integration of inland waterway transport in multimodal supply chains requires the physical and digital connection to other land transport modes and maritime transport. Digitalisation is not a goal in itself but an important supporting development required to remain competitive and to improve the connectivity to ports, other transport modes and the clients (e.g. to keep the direct costs low and to allow synchromodal solutions). Digital interconnectivity (with logistics systems and other digital platforms for transport) is crucial to increase the modal share of IWT in multimodal logistics chains and to be able to significantly contribute to the modal shift goals as presented in the Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy[3].Proposals are expected to focus on the integration of smart vessels, smart infrastructure, smart data and smart governance in multimodal logistics chains. The proposals should address all of the following aspects:Building on the results of previous and on-going Horizon 2020, Horizon Europe and Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) funded projects, identify, develop and test robust technical and operational solutions and tools (also exploring innovative technologies such as generative Artificial Intelligence) to connect physically and digitally IWT to existing land and waterborne multimodal logistics chains for a sustainable, efficient, safe, resilient, automated IWT with a view to synchromodal transport;Define and develop key parts of the IWT-related aspects of a common framework for multi-modal data sharing, while enabling compatibility with legacy systems; building upon the concepts and solutions developed in other Union initiatives aimed to facilitate data sharing in transport, such as the Digital Transport and Logistics Forum (DTLF), the European mobility data space (EMDS), the electronic Freight Transport Information regulation; and considering high value datasets, the revised Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) Directive[4] and River Information Services (RIS) Directive. Outside of the scope are any type of new platforms or similar; rather, proposals are expected to leverage existing frameworks or platforms to ensure effective use case implementation (e.g. proposed solutions could interface with and be integrated in existing platforms used by shippers, carriers and freight forwarders to connect with multimodal information). Proposals could also identify datasets already available or that could be developed in order to enhance the integration of IWT in multimodal supply chains;Define and test applications and use cases, building on the proposed solutions for advanced cooperative Smart Shipping and Smart Logistics, including integration with the physical infrastructure, in at least four demonstration pilots in actual operational environments (minimum at TRL 7). The pilots should focus on better integrating inland waterway transport in the multimodal supply chains, with a focus on cross border applications, on the accessibility and usability of node services in an automated/digital manner, and on efficient and green operations. The pilots should cover different types of goods, different routes and IWT basins (to have better EU geographical coverage), possibly along the Trans-European Transport Network corridors. To ensure a user and governance perspective approach, the pilot cases should be led by industry stakeholders (e.g. freight forwarders, intermodal operators), in cooperation with shippers and public administrations (involvement of public administrations is considered a priority). The impact of increased automation and digitalisation on all stakeholders should be considered",

Significant volumes of advanced biofuels and renewable fuels of non-biological origin (RFNBOs) are needed to cover the current fleets and the sectors where renewable fuels are the main long-term solution, such as aviation and shipping and energy-intensive industries. Therefore, an exceptional effort is needed to establish more successful projects where full-scale plants are built and operated based on the vast potential of sustainable feedstocks throughout the EU.Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:Energy producers and consumers in transport and energy-intensive industries benefit from the mobilisation of building of industrial capacity for advanced biofuels and renewable fuels of non-biological origin;Technology developers benefit from the support to the preparation of first-of-a-kind plants of advanced biofuels and/or renewable fuels of non-biological origin to become precursors for the following commercial plants;Technology providers benefit from the de-risking of the innovative technologies, reduction of CAPEX and production costs, boosting of scale-up and contribution to market up-take of advanced biofuels and/or renewable fuels of non-biological origin;Public authorities, citizens, researchers, and industrial stakeholders benefit from the improvement of the sustainability, reliability, robustness, and security of the relevant value chain;National authorities profit from the provided evidence for innovative advanced biofuels and/or renewable fuels of non-biological origin technologies, which can contribute to the Renewable Energy Directive indicative target for innovative renewable energy technology in each Member State of at least 5 % of newly installed renewable energy capacity by 2030, as well as to the targets under ReFuelEU Aviation and FuelEU Maritime. Policy makers and regulators profit from the provided factual information and evidence in view of their decision as regards accelerating permitting procedures, harvesting benefits from multiple uses of land and water and increasing the responsiveness of research and innovation in that field to diverse societal interests and concerns; The implementation of the Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET Plan) Action for Renewable Fuels and Bioenergy is supported and facilitated. Scope:Demonstrate innovative large-scale production of liquid advanced biofuels and/or renewable fuels of non-biological origin for sectors with specific need for such fuels (particularly aviation and shipping and energy-intensive industries). Production is expected to be based on various EU sustainable biomass feedstocks, notably biogenic residues and wastes, biogenic part of slurries and industrial wastes, and/or on non-biological origin feedstocks, such as renewable hydrogen and CO2 or renewable carbon, nitrogen, or their compounds, through chemical, biochemical, biological, and thermochemical pathways, or a combination of them. Proposals are expected to:demonstrate large scale production of ready-to-deploy advanced biofuels and/or renewable fuels of non-biological origin, engaging feedstock developers and suppliers, technology developers, fuel suppliers, end users for purchasing the quantities, national bodies, and public or private authorities with funding capacity;address and assess the impact of actual, real-size feedstocks, (like for example agricultural wastes, energy crops grown on marginal and degraded lands or as intermediate crops, forestry wastes, biogenic municipal and industrial wastes, all types of renewable hydrogen, actual streams of CO2 and nitrogen, available renewable carbon or their compounds), in terms of their constitution on plant design, (e.g. for feedstock pretreatment and wastewater treatment as appropriate);address and assess the impact on plant design and feasibility of improving the feedstocks externally and upstream to the fuel production plant, by increasing the energy density of the feedstocks through for example torrefaction, by homogenisation of feedstocks for making them uniform or similar, and by standardisation of feedstocks, as appropriate. Projects should produce a lifetime cycle analysis of their production route and in particular for renewable fuels of non-biological origin, as inputs in terms of renewable energy and material (CO2, nitrogen, renewable hydrogen) may not be continuously available.Production of renewable hydrogen as an end-product is excluded from the scope of this topic.The projects are expected to result in reference cases for ready-to-build, revamp/reuse and/or operate full-scale plants of advanced biofuels and/or renewable fuels of non-biological origin. Improvements, optimisation, new schemes and modification of existing demonstration plants that can result into the preparation of the next full-scale plant are considered within scope to encourage deployment of cost-effective solutions.The plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results should include a strong investment",

At the same time, it calls for research on the cumulative impacts of offshore energy generation on the environment, which was also underlined in the Communication on Delivering on the EU offshore renewable energy ambitions (2023)[2].Our knowledge on such impacts, positive and negative, is more advanced now than when the Offshore Strategy was adopted[3]. However, there are still significant data and knowledge gaps. Most fieldwork studies have been carried out at very localised sites and often focused on specific species. These ad-hoc studies lead to conclusions that can hardly be generalised. A sound monitoring, measuring multiple pressures and impacts on ecosystems and their services, at wider scale and in interaction with other sea activities, is still largely missing. There is also a need to further develop models and other instruments for environmental risk assessment, identification of mitigation measures and recommendations for restoration measures, considering impacts during construction, operation and maintenance, repowering and decommissioning.Improving instruments, data, and knowledge on the cumulative environmental impacts of offshore energy, as well as a sound monitoring, is key to ensure that its expected fast and large-scale deployment will be sustainable. It will also better equip the EU to contribute to mitigate such impacts and promote sustainable deployment of offshore wind at regional (e.g., through OSPAR[4] in the Northeast Atlantic) or subregional (e.g., through the Greater North Sea basin Initiative) level.Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:The scientific community, public authorities, project designers, permitting authorities, civil society organisations and citizens have better tools (including Maritime Spatial Planning tools), reliable data and knowledge to monitor, assess and minimise the cumulative environmental, including on biodiversity, and socio-ecological impacts of large-scale bottom-fixed and floating offshore wind energy generation, including at sea-basin level and when combined with other planned or existing human activities;The monitoring of cumulative environmental impacts, including on biodiversity, of offshore wind installations is improved, with better tools and open data, in a coherent scheme with pre-existing monitoring programs of the marine environment at large scale;Ambitious national and regional offshore wind deployment targets are achieved with positive or minimum negative impacts on the marine and coastal environment;Deploy offshore wind energy with minimal impact on marine and coastal ecosystems, and, if possible, with net-positive ones. Scope:Proposals are expected to address at least five of the following aspects:Provide better knowledge and understanding of the cumulative environmental impacts of the offshore wind energy deployment according to the EU targets, when added to the current and planned human activities carried out in the same areas;Expand existing studies, field monitoring, and analysis from local to larger areas, and from site- or species-specific impacts to more general ones. Further develop and deploy field monitoring activities, measuring multiple pressures and impacts on marine and coastal ecosystems and their services, as well as pollution, from installation to decommissioning and possible repowering, including operational phase and maintenance activities;Test and demonstrate field monitoring and modelling technologies that allow to go beyond state-of-knowledge, regarding life-cycle environmental impacts of offshore wind energy deployments;Improve instruments and models for Maritime Spatial Planning, and environmental assessments at plan and project level that are in alignment with public authorities’ needs;Improve modelling capacity and environmental impact assessments of future offshore wind deployment;Support the identification of areas where wind energy deployment is particularly suitable without significant environmental impact and areas where on the contrary, it should be avoided;Identify strategies, test, and demonstrate technologies that avoid, minimise, mitigate and compensate the environmental impact of bottom-fixed and floating offshore wind energy systems, propose mitigation and restoration measures and if feasible, provide net-positive environmental impacts.

Scope:EU and associated countries continue to develop innovative building solutions that support the decarbonisation and climate resilience of buildings and the built environment, addressing energy performance, circularity, sustainability, resource efficiency, climate resilience, safety, durability and adaptability of the building stock, and whole life carbon emissions. A key challenge remains the accelerated uptake of such solutions in building and renovation projects. Building value chain actors - such as housing association, municipal and regional authorities, or policy makers - require planning methods and procedures that embed the uptake of innovative building solutions and define pathways for the decarbonisation and climate resilience of the building stock and the built environment under their responsibility.Proposals are expected to address all of the following:Develop and validate replicable and scalable planning methods and procedures that embed the uptake of innovative sets of building solutions when developing or regenerating (including deconstruction aspects when relevant) the building stock and the built environment;Validate the planning methods, procedures and sets of building solutions in a relevant environment in at least three countries, with different climatic conditions and building stock characteristics. In at least two cases, the proposed planning methods and procedures should be relevant for renovation;Investigate the use of innovative tools and methods which facilitate the adaptation of the buildings stock to changing user needs, while positively contributing to occupants’ comfort and health;Propose and apply a methodology for assessing the effectiveness of the developed pathways for the decarbonisation and climate resilience of buildings and the built environment, including the calculation of their whole life carbon reduction compared to a “business as usual” scenario;Ensure the active involvement of all relevant public and private stakeholders of the whole renovation and construction value chain, which must include among others: municipalities, citizens (including vulnerable groups) and civil society organisations and the building and construction sector professions;Contribute to the objectives of the Built4People partnership and its network of innovation clusters[2]. Selected proposals could consider the involvement of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) whose contribution could consist of providing added value on innovative building solutions for resource efficiency, safety, durability and adaptability of the building stock, as well as performing experimental research for validating those solutions on full-scale prototype buildings.This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise (including social innovation), in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘People-centric sustainable built environment’ (Built4People). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on results to the European Partnership ‘People-centric sustainable built environment’ (Built4People) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.[1] “Supporting the development of a roadmap for the reduction of whole life carbon of buildings”, European Union, 2023’. This publication commissioned by the European Commission includes the following definition: “Whole life carbon encompasses all greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the materials, construction and the use of a building over its entire life, including its demolition and disposal. It is thus the total amount of embodied and operational emissions.”[2] https://built4people.eu/nebula_project/Show more Topic descriptionExpected Outcome:Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:Improved planning methods and procedures which are replicable and scalable across Europe, and potentially globally, and that embed the uptake of building solutions to improve whole life carbon performance[1], circularity, sustainability, climate resilience, safety and durability of buildings and the built environment, in line with the",

Advanced biofuels and renewable fuels of non-biological origin are in EU’s portfolio of technologies that contribute to net-zero manufacturing in Europe. However, remaining challenges impacting the security of supply and competitiveness of these technologies and the integration of their value chains need to be clearly understood, presented, and mitigated.Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:Energy consumers benefit from the contribution to improved EU energy security and industrial competitiveness of renewable fuel technologies;Energy producers and consumers benefit from the improved reliability, robustness and security of renewable fuel technologies (compared to existing ones);Diverse stakeholders, e.g., policy makers, public authorities, citizens, researchers, and industry, profit from the enhancement of common knowledge and understanding about existing opportunities of integrated value chains for advanced biofuels and renewable fuels of non-biological origin;Multi stakeholders, e.g., policy makers, technology developers, researchers, industrial and any other relevant stakeholders to the value chain, profit from the generation of multi benefits of promoting sustainable development and sustainable agriculture regarding climate change resilience and regenerative practices, accelerating renewable fuel innovation, and maximising carbon removals. Scope:Projects are expected to assess the energy security and industrial competitiveness aspects of value chains for advanced biofuels and renewable fuels of non-biological origin, in view of the new situation in the EU regarding energy security and industrial competitiveness with the rest of the word. They are expected to also evaluate how these technologies could contribute to the EU’s energy security and industrial competitiveness through detailed value chain analysis and development of future scenarios, macroeconomic modelling, and strategic decision-making methods. Value chains closer to commercialisation with the potential to contribute more to the EU 2030 targets for green transition and industrial competitiveness and value chains for technologies under development with the potential to contribute to the longer term and could duly adopt mitigation measures, are both in scope. Proposals are expected to identify the research and innovation actions needed to improve the energy security and industrial competitiveness aspects of these value chains, and implement as appropriate research activities for such optimisation, as well as new standards definitions for advanced biofuels and RFNBOs as appropriate.Competitiveness, energy security and integration challenges of the various steps in a value chain and of the relevant stakeholders are expected to be addressed. Integration aspects encompass every step of each individual value chain and every stakeholder. Proposals are expected to coordinate efforts towards development of win-win integrated solutions of sustainable value chains for advanced biofuels and renewable fuels of non-biological origin engaging all relevant stakeholders, including as relevant farmers, CO2 suppliers, technology providers, researchers, fuel producers, end users, policy makers, international organisations. Multidisciplinary issues related to advanced biofuels and renewable fuels of non-biological origin production, carbon removals, CO2 trading and valorisation, sustainable farming, production of nature-based soil amendments, fertilizers, and organic materials, fuel standardisation, trade-off/synergies of carbon farming with in-situ carbon storing and of land uses for fuels versus solar panels for derived fuels, are expected to be considered, to achieve benefits for all through the integration.Value chains of renewable hydrogen as an end-product are not within the scope of this topic.A sustainability assessment of integrated solutions including techno-economic, environmental and social aspects is expected to be carried out based on life cycle analysis.Show more Topic descriptionExpected Outcome:European energy security and industrial competitiveness are contested by the geopolitical circumstances and market situations around the world.

Scope:Buildings result in greenhouse gas emissions over their whole life cycle (operational and embodied emissions). Buildings can also contribute to long-term carbon removals by storing carbon in construction products. Construction and renovation works must also meet a variety of inter-related requirements such as structural and fire safety, acoustics, and a healthy and comfortable indoor environment. Although much research has focused on developing materials and products with reduced whole life carbon emissions, the life cycle impacts of buildings depend on a complex interaction between individual products, components and technical building systems, spatial distribution, usage during their lifetime, and other design choices. There is therefore a need to deliver buildings and renovation works with minimal life cycle impacts, in particular global warming potential, based on circularity principles, also accommodating future building use-change through design for flexibility, and using innovative combinations of products and systems that result in optimal building-level performance.Proposals are expected to address all the following:Develop solutions that facilitate optimal combinations of construction products and systems with minimal life cycle environmental impacts at the level of the building. The optimal combinations of products and systems must also account for relevant aspects of performance such as structural integrity, thermal, acoustic and hygrometric, durability, potential for deconstruction and preparation for reuse at end of life, and potential for automated or industrialised installation. The solutions should cover, among others, the design and construction phases of work;Develop decision-related processes and strategies for adaptive reuse of existing structures, such as repurposing buildings as opposed to demolish and rebuild, considering the whole life carbon emissions; Validate the solutions, processes and strategies in a relevant environment in at least three countries, with different climatic conditions and building stock characteristics;Research the whole life carbon emissions of the developed solutions on typical building typologies in the chosen countries and contribute to whole life carbon benchmarking efforts;Consider the cost effectiveness of the developed solutions including relevant business models taking into consideration end-user needs;Contribute to the development of European standards[2], where relevant;Contribute to the objectives of the Built4People partnership and to the Built4People network of innovation clusters[3]. Selected proposals could consider the involvement of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) whose contribution could consist of providing added value on circular design and building solutions that reduce life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions, and enable carbon removals, as well as performing experimental research for validating those solutions on full-scale prototype buildings.This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘People-centric sustainable built environment’ (Built4People). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on results to the European Partnership ‘People-centric sustainable built environment’ (Built4People) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.[1] “Supporting the development of a roadmap for the reduction of whole life carbon of buildings”, European Union, 2023’. This publication commissioned by the European Commission includes the following definition: “Whole life carbon encompasses all greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the materials, construction and the use of a building over its entire life, including its demolition and disposal. It is thus the total amount of embodied and operational emissions.”[2] ‘harmonised standard’ means a standard adopted by one of the European standardisation bodies listed in Annex I to Directive 98/34/EC, on the basis of a request issued by the Commission, in accordance with Article 6 of that Directive[3] https://built4people.eu/nebula_project/Show more Topic descriptionExpected Outcome:Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:Measurable reduction in whole life carbon emissions[1] and uptake of carbon removals in buildings;Increased integration of circular approaches for building construction and renovation works, with the aim of minimising lifecycle impacts;Availability of more accurate benchmarks and calculations",

Scope:The challenge is the development and demonstration of cost-effective wave energy converters that can survive in a harsh and unpredictable ocean or sea environment through demand-driven pre-commercial procurement (PCP). The challenge is open to proposals seeking to steer wave energy development in an effective way at a European level and to bring these technologies to the market.The operation of wave energy prototypes in real sea conditions is a critical step to establish confidence in the devices and to facilitate the large-scale roll-out of this renewable technology. Pre-commercial procurement has been shown to be an effective tool to de-risk such activities.The EuropeWave PCP action has introduced the ocean energy stage-gate process on a European-level procedure following the evaluation framework provided by Task 12 of the IEA Ocean Energy System Technology Collaboration Platform. It supported the development of several wave energy devices in a stage-gate process to Stage 3 (approximately TRL 6). The scope of this action is to bring wave energy technologies at Stage 4 approximately TRL7/8). Designs must achieve completion of Stage 4 activities of the IEA-OES Framework Evaluation Areas by the end of the action, including technical, socio-economic, and sustainability aspects. Proposals have to describe their jointly identified challenge, indicating how it fits into their mid-to-long term innovation plans, and specify why solutions currently available on the market or under development are not meeting their needs.Activities have to include: (1) networking related to preparation, management and coordination and (2) joint research activities related to the validation of PCP strategy. The consortium should include at least three legal entities established in different member states or Horizon Europe associated countries, as well as a minimum of two 'public procurers'. Other entities with a clear added value in the preparation and/or execution of the PCP or in coordination and networking activities might be considered.The proposed action is to be structured as following:Preparation phase: Participating users/buyers of R&D services (with either a pan-European, national, or regional focus) should agree on a common set of performance levels and associated specifications for wave energy systems. The funding from the participating users/buyers and the European Union will be used to bring forward wave energy technologies and complete Stage 4 (reach TRL7/8). The procurement is open to any entities established in the EU or countries associated to Horizon Europe, and the proposed wave energy technology must be able to evidence the satisfactory completion of stage 3 activities as a minimum prior-development requirement (with or without the support of EuropeWave). A phased approach can be considered to allow developers to qualify for selection for the Stage 4 demonstration. Demonstrators don’t have to be necessarily tested at the same site.At the end of the preparation phase, the following results are expected: i) completed tender documents, ii) signed joint procurement agreement confirming the collaboration modus operandi including the financial commitment of the buyers’ group and iii) final confirmation of the lead procurer.Execution phase: This phase will take care of implementing the PCP and its contracts.The procurement will be executed as a",

The PV market is changing fast, recently transitioning to high-efficiency crystalline silicon cell concepts (e.g., Tunnel Oxide Passivated Contact (TOPCon), Heterojunction (HJT), Interdigitated Back Contact (IBC), tandem, etc.), larger modules or novel designs (e.g., bifacial), use of new materials (e.g., anti-reflection and anti-soiling coatings, thinner glass, new encapsulants and backsheets), or increased number and topology of busbars or wires. There is no PV lifetime definition, but manufacturers usually guarantee a 25-year lifetime with an expected degradation rate of 0.8% per year. However, abnormal degradation rates are still reported for cell and module technologies due to a variety of failures which reduce reliability and increase the cost of PV systems operation.Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:Reduced degradation to levels that enable longer PV module lifetimes;Increased module durability and reliability;Resource efficiency and lifelong energy yield improvement of PV systems;Decreased levelised cost of electricity (LCOE);Execution of the solar energy joint research and innovation agenda[1]. Scope:The degradation rate might vary depending on many factors such as material properties, environmental stress (solar irradiance, humidity, temperature, wind speed, dust, etc.), installation, design and type of components and connections, with some components deteriorating on their own and others impacting additional PV components, leading to more severe failures. To tackle these issues and extend the lifetime of PV modules (and systems) proposals are expected to:Identify defects and failure modes encountered in recently developed high-efficiency or novel design c-silicon modules themselves and their components, exploring their mechanisms and root causes, reviewing each component’s susceptibility to defects and failures and impacting additional PV components;Develop, where necessary, simple, cost-effective and accurate module defect detection techniques (including through Artificial Intelligence (AI)), applicable to most PV modules and systems;Propose mitigation approaches at module and system level and validate approaches through modelling and/or AI modelling and lab testing;Perform outdoor field experiments and testing to determine degradation rates and/or to identify defects and failure modes and estimate service lifetime. Different locations representing the European range of climates are to be considered for field experiments.This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership for Innovation in Photovoltaics (EUPI-PV). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on the results to the European Partnership for Innovation in Photovoltaics (EUPI-PV) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.[1] Commission Staff Working Document ""Solar energy joint research and innovation agenda with Member States in the context of the European Research Area (ERA)""Show more Topic descriptionExpected Outcome:Photovoltaic (PV) energy systems are one of the cheapest and fastest growing sources of electricity generation, largely thanks to an important decrease in the cost of solar modules in the last 10-15 years, and to their simple installation.

Tremendous efforts in material and device engineering have also increased moisture, heat, and light-related stability. All these features render perovskite solar modules suitable for terawatt-scale energy production with a low levelised cost of electricity (LCOE). A number of companies are working on PSCs and some of them, have been establishing new pilot production lines and/or expanding production capacity. Still, the greatest challenges toward commercialisation are scaling up (including ambient manufacturing), achieving long-term stability, reducing, or eliminating the use of toxic solvents, and preventing Pb leakage into the environment.Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:Increase the potential for commercialisation of perovskite PV creating competitive technological know-how for the European PV industrial base;Support a European economic base which is stronger, more resilient, competitive, and fit for the green and digital transitions, by reducing strategic dependencies for critical raw materials and components;Support the execution of the solar energy joint research and innovation agenda[1]. Scope:Metal halide perovskite solar cells have attracted much attention because of their low-cost fabrication and high efficiency. In addition, tandem devices, especially perovskite-Si tandems, are expected to play an important role in perovskite commercialisation. Poor stability of these devices remains however the key challenge in their path toward commercialisation. To overcome this issue, a robust encapsulation technique by employing suitable materials and structures with high barrier performance against the external environment must be developed to protect perovskite devices. Dedicated manufacturing processes and equipment need also be demonstrated. Therefore, proposals are expected to address all of the following aspects:Demonstrate effective strategies to enhance the optoelectronic properties, performance and stability, and minimise the environmental impact of perovskite devices;Scale-up reliable deposition of high-quality perovskite films over large areas, (overcoming the degradation of efficiency as device/module areas scale up) but also patterning and interconnections to connect individual cells into modules;Demonstrate internal and external encapsulation structures as protection from extrinsic environmental stressors, such as moisture, oxygen, heat, and illumination;Develop module designs considering recyclability requirements and restrictions as to the control and management of toxic Pb2+ that could be produced by the irreversible deterioration of the perovskite materials;Assess performance and reliability according to international standards and compared with well-established PV technologies; develop and apply test protocols for performance and reliability tailored to the features of perovskite and/or perovskite-Si tandem technology.Demonstrate suitable equipment adapted to the specific requirements of perovskite (or perovskite-Si tandem) production process. Proposals are expected to involve multidisciplinary consortia including at least one perovskite or equipment manufacturer.Whenever the expected exploitation of project results entails developing, creating, manufacturing and marketing a product or process, or in creating and providing a service, the plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results must include a strategy for such exploitation. The exploitation plan should include preliminary plans for scalability, commercialisation, and deployment (feasibility study, business plan) indicating the possible funding sources to be potentially used (in particular the Innovation Fund).This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership for Innovation in Photovoltaics (EUPI-PV). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on the results to the European Partnership for Innovation in Photovoltaics (EUPI-PV) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.[1] Commission Staff Working Document ""Solar energy joint research and innovation agenda with Member States in the context of the European Research Area (ERA)""Show more Topic descriptionExpected Outcome:The rapid development of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) over the past decade makes it the most promising next generation photovoltaic technology, owing to its prominent advantages such as tuneable bandgap, high absorption coefficients, uncomplicated preparation process and considerable power conversion efficiency which has reached a certified 26.7% at cell level.

Scope:Development of new or emerging capture technologies with high potential for cost reduction. Proposals shall address capture of CO2 either from one of the following areas (and explicitly identify which is being covered): Point sources, orDirectly from air (direct air capture, DAC). Depending on the capture routes chosen (e.g., solvents, sorbents, membranes, cryogenic, solid looping), examples of important issues to address include enhanced absorption/adsorption, improved kinetics and reduced energy use for CO2 capture and desorption, new materials with high selectivity for CO2 capture, flexibility of operation, modularisation and scale-up, space occupation, degradation and life span of capture materials, ability for retrofit, potential for heat integration, and solvent-induced corrosion.In particular for DAC, examples of important issues to address are novel sorbent or solvent materials that have higher CO2 capture capacities and longer-term stability in the presence of heat and air. For all proposals, minimisation of health and environmental impact must be addressed in the project also in view of future scaling up. The developed technologies should aim at delivering CO2 at the specifications required for transport and storage, with very low levels of impurities.For point-source capture, the technologies should address the performance profile and characteristic when operating under variable operating conditions such as load changes to maintain and as high as possible capture rate across the entire operating profile. Results from point-source capture should provide good matches between specific industrial application and capture technology while guaranteeing the quality and continuity of the industrial process.The use of the European Research Infrastructure for CO2 Capture, Utilisation, Transport and Storage ECCSEL is encouraged but not mandatory.In particular for DAC, international cooperation with participating countries of the Mission Innovation Carbon Dioxide Removal Mission[1] is encouraged.[1] Carbon Dioxide Removal – Mission Innovation (mission-innovation.net)Show more Topic descriptionExpected Outcome:Project results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:New capture technologies (either from points sources or directly from air) should lead to reduced overall cost of capture, as well as lowest possible negative environmental impact, including water use.

(Pre-)proposals must be submitted electronically using the Electronic Proposal Submission System (EPSS): https://proposals.etag.ee/sustainable-blue/2025.The online system may experience high traffic volumes in the last hours before the submission deadline and it is therefore highly recommended to submit the final version of the pre / full proposal well in advance of the deadline to avoid any last-minute technical problems.Requests for extensions of the deadline due to last-minute technical problems will not be considered. Any proposals not correctly submitted at this moment will be declared ineligible.Evaluation procedures:Detailed procedures are available in the call text.A two-step evaluation procedure will apply: pre-proposal stage (Step 1) and full proposal stage (Step 2).Pre-proposal stage (Step 1)The eligible pre-proposals will be evaluated by a minimum of two independent evaluators of the IEC, and as far as possible, by three independent evaluators of the IEC who will be assigned by matching expert profiles with the need for pre-proposals evaluation, on two criteria:-Excellence (Threshold: 3/5)-Impact (Threshold: 3/5)This Step 1 aims to identify the best proposals to proceed to step 2 and to ensure a balance between requested and available funds at the national level.The ranked eligible pre-proposals will be sent to the CSC and be divided into 3 groups, according to their scores: Group A (highest evaluation scores), Group B (medium evaluation scores), and Group C (under the threshold scores). All pre-proposals in Group A will be invited to Step 2. Among the pre-proposals in Group B, proposals will be selected for step 2, considering the ranking list, the representativeness of all PFOs, and the funding ratio limits. Group C will be dismissed for their low ranking and unavailability of funding.Full proposal stage (Step 2)All eligible full proposals will be subject to a scientific evaluation by at least three independent reviewers of the IEC who will be assigned by matching expert’s profiles with the need for full proposals evaluation. One of the IEC members will be nominated as a rapporteur.The evaluation of each full proposal will be based on the following criteria:-Excellence (Threshold: 3/5)-Impact (Threshold: 3/5)-Quality and efficiency of implementation (Threshold: 3/5)During the IEC meeting, the evaluators will present the evaluation results of each proposal. The IEC will discuss full proposals and agree on the final scores for each criterion.The final ranking list will be forwarded to the CSC, which will meet to decide on the projects to be recommended for funding by PFOs.Show more Submission & evaluation process Submission procedures:A two-stage procedure will apply to this Joint Transnational Call; at stage 1 the submission of pre-proposals is mandatory, and at stage 2, applicants must submit full proposals upon invitation.

Pre-proposals and full proposals must be submitted electronically via a specifically designed web platform, the Electronic Proposal Submission System, using the templates provided and in line with the Guidelines for Proposal Submission.Applicants should note that the online system may experience high traffic volumes in the last hours before the submission deadline and it is therefore highly recommended to submit the final version of the pre / full-proposal well in advance of the deadline to avoid any last-minute technical problems. Requests for extensions of the deadline due to last minute technical problems will not be considered.Evaluation ProceduresA two-step evaluation procedure will apply, for the pre-proposals (step 1) and the full proposals (step 2) respectively. The evaluation procedure will be common for all proposals submitted under the JTC and Early Career Researcher (ECR) modality. The Call Secretariat (CS) will check that no Conflict of Interest exists concerning the proposals evaluated.All proposals, either submitted under the Regular or the ECR modality, will be evaluated by the same Evaluation Panel (EP) and in accordance with the same evaluation criteria defined in chapter 5 of the Call Announcement, and ranked in the same ranking list.An independent observer will be invited as external observer to the EP meetings to assess the conformity of the general procedure with the EU regulation.Step 1 (Pre-proposal stage)Pre-proposals submitted correctly and within the deadline will be checked for eligibility by the Call Secretariat against criteria defined in chapter 4 of the Call Announcement and by the Funding Partner Organisations (FPOs) according to their national/regional criteria.All eligible pre-proposals should be subject to a scientific evaluation by three EP members, as far as possible, based on two criteria - ‘Excellence’ and ‘Impact’. One of the evaluators will act as the rapporteur during the EP meeting.During the EP meeting, the evaluation results of each pre-proposal will be presented by the rapporteur. The EP will discuss the pre-proposals and agree on the final scores for each criterion. All applicants will receive a consensus report from the EP.A ranking list of pre-proposals will be produced, including only those pre-proposals that meet the minimum threshold, i.e., 3 out of 5 in each criterion. The final score will be agreed by the EP for each criterion, and afterwards, the two criteria will be summed up to produce the final score.The objective of this first step is to identify the best proposals to proceed to Step 2 and to ensure balance between requested and available funds at the national/regional level. The ranked eligible pre-proposals will be sent to the Call Steering Committee (CSC) and divided in 3 groups, according to their scores: Group A (highest evaluation scores), Group B (medium evaluation scores) and Group C (low evaluation scores). All pre-proposals in Group A, will be invited to Step 2. Among the pre-proposals in Group B, proposals will be selected to Step 2, taking into account the ranking list, the representativeness of all FPOs, the participation in the ECR modality and the funding ratio limits. Pre-proposals in Group C will be dismissed for their low classification.Consortium Coordinators will be informed of the outcomes by the CS and, if appropriate, invited to submit a full proposal.Step 2",

Scope:Many public buyers around Europe still lack experience on innovation procurement and need training and guidance. To tackle this challenge, several countries around Europe have set up national competence centers that cooperate with policy makers in their country to implement capacity building measures for innovation procurement. With support of Horizon 2020 funding, in the past, five new competence centers were set up and started collaborating with five existing competence centers across borders[1].Europe wide benchmarking identified that there are still significant gaps in national capacity building structures for innovation procurement[2]. This action therefore aims to support setting up a European wide network of national competence centers for innovation procurement[3], inspired by the experience and activities of the previous initiative, and extend it further to additional countries and reinforce its activities.Activities undertaken by the network are expected to include the creation of new national competence centers for innovation procurement[4] as well as the enlargement and deepening of the scope of activities of existing competence centers. The expected minimum participation is 10 existing national competence centers for innovation procurement plus 5 public bodies that have the mandate to setup 5 new national competence centers for innovation procurement in 5 different Member States or Associated Countries, with at least 2 of the 5 new ones in ‘emerging’ or ‘moderate’ innovator countries[5]. The network will thus start with participation from at least 15 different EU Member States or Associated Countries and it is expected to aim for participation of national competence centers for innovation procurement from all Member States in the network by the end of the project.Activities undertaken by the network should also include experience sharing on the implementation of pre-commercial procurement (PCP) and public procurement of innovative solutions (PPI) across Europe, promoting Horizon Europe funding and synergies with ESIF funding for PCP and PPI to public procurers in cooperation with NCPs as well as supporting public procurers in launching such procurements.Cooperation among public procurers is important because potential market size is a key decision factor for firms to participate or not in a public procurement and to help them grow their business across Europe. Scaling up the impacts of completed innovation procurements by diffusing the uptake of innovative solutions to other public buyers is also vital to mainstream innovation procurement. Activities undertaken by the network are therefore also expected to facilitate the creation of national and transnational buyer groups that ensure wider diffusion of innovations from innovation procurements as well as the creation of transnational buyer groups that start new joint innovation procurements on new topics. In this context, attention should be paid to reinforcing procurements that involve strategic technologies that are key for safeguarding Europe’s economic security. The network is also expected to promote national innovation procurement business opportunities to companies across other EU Member States and Associated Countries. It is encouraged to collaborate closely with the EIC business acceleration services and the Enterprise Europe Network to ensure a wide outreach among European startups and SMEs and raise their awareness on the business opportunities offered by innovation procurement across EU Member States and Associated Countries.Planned activities are also expected to include collaboration with national policy makers that are responsible for the policies that support the uptake of innovation procurement, in particular R&I and public procurement policies. The competence centers should cooperate with such policy makers to develop and",

Scope:The lack of later-stage funding and partners for expansion to foreign markets is one of the most problematic aspects of business growth particularly for the startups from less developed innovation ecosystems. In order to scale to a leading business, startups need to expand to foreign markets beyond their region. At earlier stages start-ups are typically supported by local investors and partners. However, in order to expand inside the EU they would need access to the funding from actors with presence and knowledge in these new markets. The lack of partners for expansion to foreign markets beyond their region is harmful for local start-ups’ growth and investor activity and the development of regional scale-ups, even more so for women-led companies. While the limited number of established European start-up hubs attract significant money and traction, the innovation ecosystems in other areas struggle to keep pace with fewer resources, including funds and technical expertise. In the struggle for resources, many start-ups face the choice to either forego growth and ultimately close their business or move elsewhere, while foreign investors struggle to enter new markets due to insufficient information about the market, its opportunities and regulatory frameworks.If organised and structured, investments ecosystems should be able to attract foreign investors into “emerging’ and ‘moderate’ innovation ecosystems by raising awareness of local innovation ecosystems and their start-ups, as well as the potential of the whole region, to capital providers from across Europe.

Each partner must fulfil the conditions of the national/regional funding organisation, as detailed in the Call documentation.The Call is open to international consortia involving partners from entities such as:Universities,Public research institutes, organisations, and centres,Private entities conducting research in QT.The grant for one legal entity being a partner organisation in one or more project consortia in the Call cannot exceed 1,000,000.00 EUR. This maximum amount, however, may be higher if the objective of the action would be impossible or overly difficult to achieve (and duly substantiated).EvaluationThe evaluation relies on international Evaluation Panels of experts, one for the Call topic of Quantum Phenomena and Resources (QPR) and one for Applied Quantum Science (AQS).Proposals are evaluated based on the criteria of Excellence, Impact, and Quality and efficiency of the implementation. Each evaluation criterion is assigned a score (ranging from 0 to 5) along with a corresponding weight. The threshold for each of the three criteria used for the evaluation is 3. The overall threshold, applying to the sum of the 3 individual scores with their respective coefficients, is 12 points.SelectionBased on the two ranking lists (AQS, QPR) provided by the Evaluation Panels, a final list of projects selected for funding will be approved by the QuantERA Call Steering Committee (CSC). CSC is the highest decision-making body of the QuantERA Call 2025, composed of Research Funding Organisations participating in the Call.Whilst typically the highest-ranked proposals will be selected for funding, there may be cases where a proposal cannot be funded due to budget constraints. Specifically, this may occur if one or more funding agencies have exhausted their budgets with no possibility of an increase, the European Commission's contribution through the gap-filling mechanism cannot cover the shortfall, and reducing the funding for project(s) supported by the affected Research Funding Organisation(s) is either impossible or would significantly impact the original proposal, i.e. such reductions could alter the proposal’s scope to the extent that its original ranking would be called into question. In such exceptional circumstances when the project in question cannot be funded, and the relevant funding agencies approve such solution, the choice may pass to the next highest-ranked proposal which can be fully supported.If at a given rank in the list not all ex aequo proposals can be selected, the criteria listed below will be applied in the following order:Maximisation of overall funding output – prioritising projects to ensure the highest possible overall funding is distributed,Comparability of success rates between topics – ensuring that the rates for both AQS and QPR topics are comparable,Inclusivity of funding across organisations – ensuring, if possible, that each",

Through research and innovation and capacity building we enable local authorities and municipalities, service and infrastructure providers, and citizens to translate global strategies into local action.We develop the skills and tools to make urban change happen and boost the urgently needed urban transformations towards a sustainable future with enhanced quality of life in cities.About the CallThe purpose of this Call is to support transnational research and/or innovation projects addressing urban challenges to help cities in their transition towards a more sustainable economy and functioning. The challenges are grouped into three themes called Transition Pathways: Positive Energy Districts (PED), the 15-Minute City (15mC) and Circular Urban Economies (CUE).The projects selected within this Call will be funded directly by national/regional Funding Agencies from the following countries:List can be found on the Call websiteEach proposal must involve, at least, three partners from three countries of this list and eligible for funding by their respective national/regional Funding Agency. Two of those three countries must be eligible for EC Co-Fund (EU member states or Horizon Associated Countries). The added value of transnational collaboration should be clearly stated.The Call is open to a wide range of scientific disciplines and welcomes interdisciplinary approaches. It intends to support a large range of activities, from research to innovation and implementation. It also asks to engage explicitly stakeholders (companies, public authorities, NGOs…) in the projects and to consider users’ needs in the identification of the project goals.Information and EventsPartnership websiteCall websiteMatchmakingDUT Call 2025 Info Day (online): 9 September 2025 10:00 – 13:00 CETCall topicsThe basis of the call topics description are the three Transition Pathways (TP): Positive Energy Districts (PED), 15-minute City (15mC), and Circular Urban Economies (CUE).For each TP, several topics are defined. The context, issues and opportunities that define each topic are first presented first, in terms that aim to inspire research and innovation ideas, along with examples of expected results and outcomes that may be addressed either through the research-oriented approach or through the innovation-oriented approach.Furthermore, since urban transition issues are intrinsically interconnected, it is possible to address several topics, either from the same or from different TPs, within the same proposal.All projects should choose as their main TP the TP that is the closest to the subject they would like to address and may indicate the other TP involved if needed. Though the proposal will be evaluated within its principal main TP, crosscutting characteristics will also be taken into account in the assessment.15-minute City Pathway (15mC)Next steps for multimodal urban mobility, building on the travel experienceReimagining parking – transforming urban parking policiesMobility policymaking in context of radical contestationCircular Urban Economies Pathway (CUE)Resilient green and social infrastructureSustainable tourism – circular benefits and challengesPublic procurement to foster urban greening and circularityPositive Energy Districts Pathway (PED)Driving a just transition: PED strategies in social and subsidised housingEnsuring positive socio-economic impact: PEDs in local economies and energy marketsPEDs in urban heating and cooling strategiesSubmissionA two-step application procedure will be used in this Joint Transnational Call. Pre-proposals and full proposals must be submitted electronically via the online submission system, using the templates provided. Additionally applications may need to be submitted on a national level.Transnational eligibility rule 6: Language and mandatory forms.

Moreover, it intends to reach out to collaboration with funding partners beyond Europe, in order to broaden the knowledge and experience bases and introduce European solutions and stakeholders to the global value chains.AboutThe Clean Energy Transition Partnership (CETPartnership) is a multilateral and strategic partnership of national and regional research, development and innovation (RDI) programmes in EU/EEA Member States and non-EU/EEA Partner Countries with the aim to substantially support the implementation of the European Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET Plan). It will contribute to higher level European policy goals towards Stepping up Europe’s 2030 climate ambition and the new European Research Area with the ultimate objective to achieve a climate-neutral society by 2050. The CETPartnership will also address the strategies outlined in the latest EC communications e.g. A Clean Planet for all and the European Green Deal.The CETPartnership enables more than 40 national and regional RTDI programme owners and managers from around 30 countries to align their priorities, pool national budgets in transnational joint calls, planned from 2022 to 2027.The CETPartnership consortium also plans to organise joint accompanying activities to enable a dynamic learning process, extract strategic knowledge ('Knowledge Community') and maximise the impact ('Impact Network') to accelerate the upscaling, replication and market diffusion of innovative solutions, as well as foster the up-take of cost-effective clean energy technologies. CETPartnership Transition InitiativesThe CETPartnership has seven Transition Initiatives (TRIs) focusing on RDI Challenges described in the Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA) that address various technologies and system aspects connected to the clean energy transition, as well as several cross-cutting dimensions. Each of the TRIs is led by one CETPartnership partner, known as the TRI Lead.TRI 1: Integrated Net-zero-emissions Energy SystemTRI 2: Enhanced zero emission Power TechnologiesTRI 3: Enabling Climate Neutrality with Storage Technologies, Renewable Fuels and CCU/CCSTRI 4: Efficient zero emission Heating and Cooling SolutionsTRI 5: Integrated Regional Energy SystemsTRI 6: Integrated Industrial Energy SystemsTRI 7: Integration in the Built EnvironmentAbout the Call: The CETPartnership Joint Call 2025 is a 2 stage-call structured with 10 Call Modules. All project proposals must be submitted through the CETPartnership Submission Platform.No project proposals will be accepted after the submission deadline. Evaluation and ranking of the project proposals will be performed separately per Call module according to the three main evaluation criteria: Excellence, Impact and Quality and efficiency of the implementation. The cut-off for being invited to the second stage or considered for funding at full proposal stage is an average or consensus score at or above 3 for all the three evaluation criteria and a total average or consensus score of or above 10. This call is co-funded by the European Commission via the CETPartnership (GA # 101069750) under the Horizon Europe Partnership scheme.Call TopicsThe CETPartnership fourth Joint Call, launched in May 2025, is structured in thematic modules.

Scope:By closing the gap between supply and demand in a way that reinforces EU open strategic autonomy, PCPs can make a key contribution to enhancing the European Union’s economy and competitiveness[1]. In order to master the green and digital transition and make our cities climate-neutral and liveable places, European public procurers need to lead by example by procuring more solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This topic therefore focuses on forward looking procurement of R&D to bring to the market new solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that can increase Europe’s resilience and preparedness to tackle the climate challenge.On the road towards climate-neutral cities this topic addresses the lack and fragmentation of public demand for innovative solutions. Europe’s companies, in particular SMEs and Startups, are indispensable in delivering the required innovations. As past experience shows that pre-commercial procurement opens up the procurement market for startups and enables the public sector to address societal challenges more effectively, public procurers should make more strategic use of PCP.This topic supports public procurers, specifically local authorities, to collectively implement PCPs to drive innovation from the demand side and open up wider commercialisation opportunities for companies in Europe to take or maintain international leadership in new markets for net-zero technologies that can deliver solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The aim is to leverage PCP to encourage the development and to provide a first customer reference for the piloting, installation and validation of breakthrough innovations.PCP actions target consortia of procurers with similar needs that want to procure together the development of innovative solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in cities. This topic does not provide direct funding to developers, industry or research organisations to perform R&D. They will be able to respond to the call for tenders launched by consortia of procurers funded under this call. Specific guidance on PCP actions and minimum eligibility requirements can be found in General Annexes H of the Horizon Europe work programme.Continuous dialogue between demand and supply side is required for the success of PCPs, therefore the effective involvement of end users (e.g. cities teams that would need to adopt climate mitigation solutions, regional structures cooperating with cities on climate mitigation, citizens etc.) needs to be considered in the proposal. Furthermore, to stimulate dialogue with the supply side, public procurers are required to organise an open market consultation before launching the procurement and to promote the call for tenders widely across Europe to potentially interested suppliers.Proposals should demonstrate sustainability of the action beyond the life of the project. They should demonstrate how the project is anchored in a clear strategy to provide climate-neutral cities and enhance the economy in a sustainable way through stronger early adoption of innovative solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Activities covered should include cooperation",

A ‘Twinning’ is a structured partnership where a ‘Twinning Donor’ with an innovative solution or approach, shares its expertise in this innovative solution or approach with another party called the ‘Twinning Receiver’. The goal of this Twinning is to implement the solution or approach being shared into the respective institution/organisation/company of the Twinning Receiver. This Call offers up to 50,000 EUR per Twinning partnership to activities that facilitate the exchange of solutions or approaches in PM and build up the capacities and capabilities of one or both participating parties. Twinning partnerships should last between 6 and 12 months. The Twinning Call will pair at least two and up to three institutions together. One institution/organisation/company will be the Donor, and the other up to two institution(s) will be the Receiver(s). The Donor institution is responsible for sharing its experience, knowledge, and practices relevant to the specific PM solution or approach with the Receiver organisation(s). Twinning partnerships should enable the Twinning Receiver(s) institution to: Initiate implementation of a defined PM solution or approach with support Adapt a PM solution or approach Partially adopt a PM solution or approach Fully adopt or acquire a solution or approach Applicants must submit their applications via EIT Health Application Platform: https://apply.eithealth.eu/s_Login.jsp. Please follow the instructions to complete account registration. If there are any questions, please see the “⁠Guide for applicants” or contact smartsimple@eithealth.eu. Main steps in process: Apply: Applicants submit their proposals through the EIT Health Smart Simple application platform. Applicants apply as a consortium with one member being the Twinning Donor organisation, and a maximum of 2 additional members being the Twinning Receiver organisations. Eligibility check: An eligibility check will be performed against the general and specific conditions stated in the Twinning call document to validate the application’s compliance with the requirements outlined in this Call. This check will yield a yes or no decision on whether submitted proposals are eligible and can progress to the next evaluation stage. Applications need to meet all the eligibility requirements specified in the call document in order to proceed to the external evaluation and be invited to pitches. Online pitching: All eligible applications will be invited to present their proposals at an online pitch between the 14-21 April 2026. Th epitching process will involve a presentation (15 minutes) of the proposal by applicants in front of a panel of independent experts and will be followed by a questions and answers session (20 minutes). Each proposal will be evaluated by three external independent evaluators. Following the online pitches, experts will produce an individual score out of 100 using the evaluation criteria specified in the call document. Only projects that receive a final score of at least 70 / 100 will be considered for funding. Funding Decision: Projects will be ranked by evaluation score, and the top ranked projects will be selected for funding. Twinning exchange: Successful consortia are given 12 months to perform the Twinning activities. Interim Report: The selected consortia submit an interim report after 6 months into the Twinning exchange to verify the ongoing activities and achievement of the project’s objectives.

Scope:This call aims to accelerate the scaling and deployment of innovative technologies by leveraging EU Missions as catalysts for lead markets. It will support both public and private stakeholders in fostering demand-driven innovation while developing proof-of-concept for deep tech solutions relevant to the Missions. By integrating Social Sciences and Humanities insights, the call will also address barriers to market uptake, risk perception, and stakeholder engagement to create enabling conditions for investment in high-impact technologies.Proposals should aim at:Scaling up innovations: develop proof-of-concept for deep tech solutions that have the potential to address EU Mission challenges (up to TRL 7).Enabling lead markets for mission-driven technologies: identify and test models that mobilise public and private stakeholders to create demand for emerging solutions, ensuring alignment with public interests (e.g., workplace safety, risk management, procurement strategies).Mobilising resources to experiment innovative procurement and financing models - like procurement of innovation, competitive dialogue or other innovation friendly procurement methods - to develop and test innovative regulatory, policy, and financial mechanisms to accelerate the uptake of high-risk, high-reward technologies in public services markets. Maximum 50% of the grant awarded can be used to support actual procurement of solutions by public service companies preferentially in small projects and supporting maximum of 25% of the procurement. Prior agreement with EU commission services is required in due time.Projects should take into account relevant insights from the projects working on the topic “Understanding and overcoming barriers to the scale-up of technologies supporting EU Missions.”Projects should cover ideally all missions, and preference will be given to proposals covering several missions.Show more Topic descriptionExpected Outcome:Expected outcomes:Stakeholders in Missions on European, national and regional level embrace their roles as actors in ‘lead markets for innovative products and services with a purpose’ that are provided by public investments in mission objectives.Some cutting-edge technologies at lower technology levels (i.e. not yet at product development stage) potentially relevant to EU Missions are advanced towards market entry by appropriate tools (for example ‘proof concept’, ‘procurement of innovation’ or others)A better alignment between public procurement, private investment, and missions’ requirement fosters favourable conditions for creation of lead markets.

Objective:This is a two-stage Challenge competition of which the ultimate ambition is to deliver scalable prototypes, validated in a relevant real-world environment. Solutions supported under the Challenge are expected to demonstrate both the novelty and applicability of the proposed Physical AI technology, while mitigating associated risks.Applicant to Stage 1 must also have a clear outlook on the potential longer-term impact(s).Stage1- Solution validation and benchmarking Applicants with disruptive physical AI systems that have achieved a prototype (i.e. at least TRL 4) will be invited to:Refine and validate the prototype in a relevant environment to demonstrate the core innovation (e.g., new perception (multimodal), actuation, continual learning, or autonomy capability, etc.). in the end use caseDevelop a methodology for performance assessmentAssess ethical, data governance and scalability considerationsIdentify challenges to integration such as safety, certification or scalability with view to identifying risks and exploring options for overcoming barriers for adoption including in cases where products’ risks are not covered by the AI ActConduct initial performance benchmarking, andDevelop an initial market analysis, business plan and model. The outputs of Stage 1 will be assessed for progress against the following milestones:Evidence of technical viability with initial performance data that benchmarks performance and disruptive potential against the state-of-the-art in at least one pilot case within the specified application area, andClear commitment from end users and stakeholders to further develop the physical AI solution in Stage 2.To maximise impact, foster collaboration, and accelerate learning across funded teams, Progress to Stage 2 will be contingent on delivering a full proposal which will be assessed alongside the milestones achieved under Stage 1. Stage 2 - Development and user testing Applicants for Stage 2 will be expected to further develop and validate a Physical AI system through the following activities:Build and test (ensure at least two deployments loops) a robust, integrated solution capable of autonomous operation in complex or semi-structured environments (e.g., pilot deployment in real world environment, etc.) to reach TRL 6-7Address scalability and manufacturability: show that the solution can be scaled or adapted for broader integration and deploymentConduct necessary testing, documentation, and compliance activities towards certification or regulatory approval of the adapted solutionOrganisation of consultation meetings/workshops with industrial end users, regulators, standard setting bodies or other relevant stakeholders to gather further needs and feedback, andDevelop a roadmap to commercialisation: refine market analysis, and validate business plan including stakeholder engagement, and identification of scaling strategies At the end of Stage 2, projects will be expected to have:Delivered a robust, integrated solution capable of autonomous operation in complex or semi-structured environments i.e. capable of pilot deployment in real world environmentDemonstrated reliability, adaptability, energy/resource efficiency, and safe human-AI interaction, andProvided evidence of necessary testing, documentation, and compliance activities towards certification or regulatory approval for the adapted solution Scope:Background and ScopeThe integration of AI into physical systems is accelerating apace. Such integration will enable machines and systems to perceive, act, and interact autonomously in complex, real-world settings.This Challenge aims to accelerate the development towards integration, deployment and commercialisation of breakthrough Physical AI solutions that will enhance Europe’s technological sovereignty, sustainability, and global competitiveness.This Challenge seeks proposals for developing disruptive Physical AI innovations that demonstrate at least two of the following characteristics:Intelligent Perception and Cognition - Encompasses robust sensing, understanding, and real-time reasoning capabilities.Adaptive Learning and Optimisation - Focuses on continuous improvement, domain-specific adaptation, and intelligent resource management.Autonomous Decision-Making and Collective Intelligence - Combines real-time problem-solving with autonomous action and swarm coordination in dynamic environments.Human-AI Collaboration and Interaction - Encompasses safe, intuitive interfaces and collaborative robotics for human-AI teamwork.Physical Integration and Innovation - Focuses on developing novel sensors, actuators, and materials that advance embodied AI capabilities.

It will:Accelerate the development and validation of disruptive NAMs for biomedical applications, including medicinal products and medical technologiesSupport regulatory innovation by providing evidence-based recommendations for the assessment of safety, efficacy, and quality of human health products using NAMs.Enable citizens to benefit from novel technologies that have been assessed through rigorous NAMs that have been validated to can predict potential effects in humans, andProvide industry with a harmonised and standardised NAM-based assessment toolkit that is faster and more flexible. Objective:Specific Objectives This is a two-stage Challenge competition with the ultimate ambition to deliver robust, validated NAMs that constitute a representative model or prototype system i.e. achieve TRL 6 after Stage 2. Applicants should apply to Stage 1 only where there is an outlook of the potential impact in the longer term.Stage 1 – Solution validation and benchmarking Applicants should:Take forward preliminary engagement with regulatory authorities, notified bodies and industry stakeholdersMap regulatory, clinical, standardisation (where applicable) and industrial needs, and use this to develop a roadmap for adoptionDevelop a methodology for performance assessmentDeliver small-scale feasibility experiments or modellingConduct initial performance benchmarking (human relevance, reproducibility, transferability of the approach)Assess ethical, data governance and scalability considerations, as applicable to the given NAM under development. The following milestones need to be achieved at the end of Stage 1:Evidence that the NAM is viable for human relevant biomedical innovation, and addresses the needs of the identified use cases, andClear commitment from industrial end-users and a well-defined regulatory plan to further develop the NAM in Stage 2. Progress to Stage 2 will be contingent on delivering a full proposal which will be assessed alongside the milestones achieved under Stage 1.Stage 2 – Development and user testing Applicants selected for Stage 2 will further develop and validate a functional, scalable NAM prototype ready for regulatory, industrial, or clinical uptake. Activities must cover a number of the following elements:Benchmarking the NAMs against state-of-the-art animal models and/or human trialsDemonstration in relevant application, such as disease modelling, or testing of medicinal products and medical technologies for safety, efficacy, or qualityOrganisation of consultation meetings/workshops with industrial end users, regulators, CROs (Contract Research Organisations), standard setting bodies or other relevant stakeholders to gather further needs and feedbackEngagement with infrastructures for testing and data collection as testing and validation of the NAM outside the developer’s labDevelopment of regulatory-grade data packages suitable for submission to relevant agencies (e.g. EMA, FDA, OECD), andDocumentation on scalability, standardisation, and potential barriers to uptake. During the project’s implementation phase, beneficiaries will be encouraged to consider using the EU Reference Laboratory for alternatives to animal testing (EURL ECVAM) of the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre for aspects of standardisation, automation and validation of in vitro methods. These facilities operate and provide support at the interface between pre-normative research, regulatory sciences and innovation.Scope:New Approach Methodologies (NAMs) have the potential to replace, reduce or refine animal use in the testing96 of medicinal products. Scientific progress in recent decades has delivered several animal-free NAMs that have the potential to transform how we understand human biology and assess the safety, efficacy, and quality testing in the health sector. However, a lack of knowledge, experience and confidence in the use of such novel methodologies has limited their adoption by end users, including, for example, industry and regulators.This Challenge competition therefore looks to accelerate the adoption of NAMs in biomedicine and support companies that want to bring NAMs to the market. Applicants should propose innovative and disruptive NAMs addressing one or both of the following areas:Preclinical biomedical researchTesting of medicinal products and medical technologies for safety, efficacy, or quality. Human organoids or microphysiological systems (e.g. organ-on-chip, disease-on-chip), in chemico methods, digital twins, virtual patient simulations, AI-enhanced predictive models, mechanistic or integrated in silico platforms, 3D- advanced human tissue model are in scope.Applicants to this Challenge call should already have:Proven the viability of their proposed solution in a lab environment at TRL 4 (lab or in silico);Have letters of intent of at least one of the following stakeholders: an industrial end-user or regulatory body interested in the proposed project; andHave access to an appropriate infrastructure to carry out the planned activities in Stage 1 and 2.

Bring this innovative clean tech solution to full technological maturity and close to market-readiness with a view to accelerating its market deployment and/or integration in key industrial sectors in Europe (e.g. manufacturing, energy and transport). Scope:The Clean Industrial Deal aims to secure the EU as an attractive location for manufacturing, including for energy-intensive industries, and to promote clean tech and new circular business models in order to meet Europe’s ambitious decarbonisation and climate neutrality and biodiversity preservation targets. It focuses primarily on the competitive decarbonisation of EU industry and on the production of clean technologies in the EU. This requires notably a considerable increase in electrification of EU energy systems and in all end-use sectors of the European economy (either directly, or via enabling intermediate technologies).The following three clean tech areas have a strong and promising growth potential in Europe. Proposals are expected to address one or several of these areas:Integrated net-zero emissions energy systems (e.g. including energy grids, networks and systems)Enhanced zero-emission power technologies (e.g. including renewable electricity, heat and energy technologies)Storage technologies, renewable fuels, and carbon capture and utilisation (CCU) (e.g. including batteries and other energy storage solutions, renewable hydrogen[4], advanced biofuels and synthetic renewable fuels) enabling climate neutrality Proposals should explicitly select one main area but can also address in an integrated way a combination of these three areas. Applicants are free to decide on the specific value chain they wish to strengthen in the above clean tech areas.As part of bringing innovative clean tech solutions closer to the market, proposals may also address step-change in relevant network and infrastructure deployment to facilitate scale up across the trans-European energy and transport networks – e.g. electricity, heat, gas, hydrogen, CO2, batteries, and refuelling networks, etc. Application of advanced innovative materials development, connected process engineering and scale-up, resource efficiency, circularity and recycling may also be addressed as part of the selected value chain, as relevant. Attention should be paid to avoid technologies which may have a negative impact on biodiversity and ecosystems.Proposals are expected to:ensure the development of innovative technological solutions along a specific clean tech value chain. For this, they need to involve an adequate combination of clean tech suppliers, energy users (e.g. manufacturing, energy and transport) and other relevant stakeholders, in order to support a sound business case, taking into account a gender-sensitive and intersectional approach.demonstrate an adequate integration of relevant technological solutions including clean tech and industrial decarbonisation solutions in support of the Clean Industrial Deal, and to ensure a clear and quantifiable impact on competitiveness and reduction of GHG emissions. Reduction or avoidance of harmful pollutants and impact on biodiversity may also be considered, as relevant[5]. The integration can either be demonstrated in a direct (e.g. energy to an industrial/transport sector) or an indirect (e.g. energy to grid to an industrial/transport sector) manner. The use of relevant results of R&I projects previously or currently funded at EU or national level is encouraged.show industrial leadership in view of the deployment after the project. To ensure market readiness and effective collaboration amongst relevant stakeholders along a specific clean tech value chain, the consortium should be industry driven and composed of a manageable number of participants (indicatively, not more than ten participants). The consortium size should be justified based on the extent of the value chain covered. The participation of SMEs is encouraged.seek coherence with the work of the Strategic Energy Technology (SET) Plan and relevant industrial initiatives. The draft dissemination, exploitation and communication plan is expected to include a sound",

Greater consistency in how socio-economic and physical science disciplines address climate change with enhanced inter- and transdisciplinary collaboration leading to improved, more realistic and more context-specific, regionally differentiated assessments of socio-economic impacts of climate change, and tailored tools to better inform strategic decisions on climate action, security and resilience by public and private actors. Knowledge on the interactions between climate change impacts, climate action and global and regional economic performance is advanced. More clarity is gained on the implications of climate change and climate policies on European competitiveness, economic security and strategic autonomy, with enhanced assessment of opportunities, risks, benefits and costs for the EU economy and citizens. Best available evidence and policy recommendations are made available in a timely manner and effectively transferred to inform the Paris Agreement, European Climate Risk Assessments (EUCRA), the European Climate Adaptation Plan, the Preparedness Union Strategy, the Clean Industrial Deal, IPCC, IPBES and other initiative. Scope: As emphasized by the IPCC, it is urgent to better understand the benefits and opportunities associated with deep, rapid and sustained mitigation and accelerated adaptation action to inform strategic decisions. Comprehensive assessments of the socio-economic impacts of climate change are essential for this, however, current approaches face significant challenges with a wide uncertainty in global damage estimates, fragmentation, lack of comparability across methodologies, and reliance on extrapolation from historical data, increasingly unrealistic in the context of current unprecedented changes in the climate system. Actions should develop and enhance models, methods, and tools to improve the understanding of future socio-economic costs of climate inaction (for the purpose of this topic defined as insufficient, or delayed action), advancing novel approaches and frameworks to address the limitations in existing methodologies, integrating latest scientific evidence, diverse data sources and applicable to various conditions and contexts. In this context, actions are encouraged to leverage emerging digital capabilities, including, if appropriate, those developed under initiatives like Destination Earth. Research should account for the full spectrum of climate impacts, such as those from extreme and low-probability high-impact events and the consequences of trespassing Earth system tipping points, to ensure more comprehensive and accurate assessments. Cascading and compound effects as well as non-market impacts (e.g. health, biodiversity and ecosystems, migration) should be considered. Actions should also contribute to rethinking discount rates and damage functions to better reflect the long-term uncertainty of climate impacts and their implications. Actions should assess foregone co-benefits and missed opportunities of climate inaction, and their distribution, ranging from health-related gains to economic benefits like business and industrial opportunities, job creation, energy and economic security, innovation and lower costs, as well as environmental and social improvements such as from biodiversity conservation, and reduced inequalities. They should assess increased adaptation needs and costs associated with inadequate mitigation, accelerated climate impacts, lost resilience, crossing of adaptation limits as well as the impact on public budgets[1]. To provide the full picture, the cost of climate inaction should be compared with the cost of ambitious mitigation and adaptation. Actions should emphasise treatment of uncertainty, ethics, inequality and justice in the economic analysis of climate change. They should explore approaches more compatible with planetary boundaries, going beyond traditional welfare and cost-effectiveness models. This topic requires interdisciplinary collaboration between physical scientists, economists and other relevant SSH disciplines. Actions should include a process of co-design with stakeholders (e.g., representatives of governments, public administrations, such as civil protection competent authorities, or the private sector) to support uptake of the results. Proposals are expected to address only one of the following priority areas, which should be clearly indicated: Area A: Global Analysis should be global in scale, while also providing regionally resolved insights to enable comparisons across world regions, distinguishing between developing and developed, and duly reflecting diverse circumstances and contexts. International cooperation is generally encouraged and specifically required with low and lower/upper-middle-income countries[2] – particularly major GHG emitters[3] such as China (contributing to the EU-China Climate Change and Biodiversity (CCB) flagship initiative[4]), India, Brazil and Indonesia. It should enable delivery of robust, representative and widely accepted estimates, and support scientific capacity building where appropriate. Area B: The EU Actions should focus on the EU. Particular attention should be given to consequences for EU industrial performance, security of supply and strategic autonomy.

In line with the Strategic Plan, the overall expected impact of this Destination is to contribute to the “Advancing science for a transition to a climate-neutral and resilient society”. Expected impacts: Research should contribute to closing major knowledge gaps on the changing climate together with their associated impacts and risks, on both society and nature. It should also help develop tools to support decision-makers in designing and implementing effective mitigation and adaptation actions at various time and spatial scales while properly accounting for synergies and trade-offs with other policy objectives, such as just transition, territorial cohesion and leaving no one behind. The main impacts to be generated by topics under this Destination are: Supporting climate action (both mitigation and adaptation) in Europe and globally, through advancing climate science and the knowledge base underpinning actionable solutions, to accelerate the transition to a climate-neutral, climate-resilient and prosperous society. Closing key knowledge gaps related to climate change, thereby contributing substantially to key European and international assessments such as IPCC, IPBES, EUCRA, and other initiatives such as the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) and the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) under the World Climate Research Programme. Strengthening the European Research Area on climate change by boosting scientific excellence and capacity in an inclusive manner across the participating countries. Maximising synergies between mitigation and adaptation and with other policy priorities such as biodiversity and ecosystem preservation and restoration, disaster-preparedness, digitalisation, circular economy, prosperity and competitiveness, strategic autonomy, security and resilience, just transition, and the Sustainable Development Goals by exploring co-benefits, trade-offs and potential unintended consequences of climate strategies and policy interventions. Important components of climate science research are also addressed in other Clusters -particularly Cluster 6 – which addresses the climate-ocean-cryosphere-polar nexus and the climate-energy-land-food-water-biodiversity nexus. Efforts to foster synergies and complementarities across these research activities are strongly encouraged. Show more Topic conditions and documents General conditions 1.

Scope: The global community’s ability to mitigate and adapt to climate change requires the continuous advancement of climate science and related disciplines. International climate policy is informed primarily by the assessments made by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which provides the most comprehensive and authoritative evaluation of the state of knowledge on climate science, including the Earth’s climate system and its expected changes under different scenarios. Despite the exponential increase of available data, other evidence and knowledge accumulated on these issues, there remain significant gaps in our understanding of key issues and processes. These may include factors such as insufficient or divergent evidence, low confidence findings or high uncertainties. Some of these gaps are identified in AR6 (specifically, in Working Group I contribution), “The Next Frontier for Climate Change Science”[1] and other relevant sources. Moreover, science has progressed since the closing of the evidence base used for AR6, raising new questions and avenues for inquiry. Proposals under this topic should seek to narrow the knowledge gaps in the realm of Earth system science (understood here as the scope of Working Group I of the IPCC), offering flexibility for applicants to define the specific research areas targeted. Proposals are expected to focus on issues clearly within the scope of Cluster 5, Destination 1, and not prominently addressed by other topics of the 2025 and 2026-2027 Work Programmes, encouraging new scientific insights and approaches, and the involvement of researchers and entities new to Horizon Europe. Successful proposals are expected to enhance the scientific foundations and inform scientific assessments in a way that ensures they are comprehensive, accurate, and relevant for decision-makers. Proposals should clearly identify the knowledge gap(s) they seek to address, substantiate why recent and ongoing research efforts are unlikely to sufficiently address the issue, explain how the proposed action is expected to contribute to the advancement of Earth system science and identify policy relevance of the research proposed. International cooperation in the context of IPCC, WCRP[2] and GCOS[3] is strongly encouraged where relevant. Proposals indicating use of satellite remote sensing data and derived products are encouraged to collaborate with projects selected under ESA’s FutureEO programme and the EC-ESA Earth System Science Initiative (ESSI) to facilitate access to and uptake of satellite data products and related tools or methodologies. They should dedicate resources for collaborative actions.

In line with the Strategic Plan, the overall expected impact of this Destination is to contribute to the “Advancing science for a transition to a climate-neutral and resilient society”. Expected impacts: Research should contribute to closing major knowledge gaps on the changing climate together with their associated impacts and risks, on both society and nature. It should also help develop tools to support decision-makers in designing and implementing effective mitigation and adaptation actions at various time and spatial scales while properly accounting for synergies and trade-offs with other policy objectives, such as just transition, territorial cohesion and leaving no one behind. The main impacts to be generated by topics under this Destination are: Supporting climate action (both mitigation and adaptation) in Europe and globally, through advancing climate science and the knowledge base underpinning actionable solutions, to accelerate the transition to a climate-neutral, climate-resilient and prosperous society. Closing key knowledge gaps related to climate change, thereby contributing substantially to key European and international assessments such as IPCC, IPBES, EUCRA, and other initiatives such as the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) and the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) under the World Climate Research Programme. Strengthening the European Research Area on climate change by boosting scientific excellence and capacity in an inclusive manner across the participating countries. Maximising synergies between mitigation and adaptation and with other policy priorities such as biodiversity and ecosystem preservation and restoration, disaster-preparedness, digitalisation, circular economy, prosperity and competitiveness, strategic autonomy, security and resilience, just transition, and the Sustainable Development Goals by exploring co-benefits, trade-offs and potential unintended consequences of climate strategies and policy interventions. Important components of climate science research are also addressed in other Clusters -particularly Cluster 6 – which addresses the climate-ocean-cryosphere-polar nexus and the climate-energy-land-food-water-biodiversity nexus. Efforts to foster synergies and complementarities across these research activities are strongly encouraged. Show more Topic conditions and documents General conditions 1.

Scope: Climate change science is well-established and increasingly relevant to daily life and societal welfare. However, effectively communicating both the science and the necessary climate actions remains a significant challenge. Particularly challenging is understanding and addressing the spread of misinformation, disinformation, and misinterpretation. There is also a crucial need for a strengthened public trust in science and in democracy, and for evidence-based climate communication strategies that foster a sense of agency through empowering and positive narratives. Complex messages should be made accessible, relevant, and reliable to non-specialist audiences. Actions are expected to advance the understanding of the sources, channels, types, and influence of misinformation and disinformation on the public perception and assimilation of climate change-related information. The role of AI should also be investigated. Actions should identify, develop, and test strategies for the public and private sectors to detect, monitor and counteract mis/disinformation about climate and climate policy. Such tools and products should be made available for policymakers, companies and the general public to incentivise and equip society to critically assess climate change-related information online and offline. Research is expected to explore how to bridge the gap from climate knowledge and awareness to behavioural change, taking into consideration various factors that shape perceptions across different segments of the society. Actions should generate knowledge and develop innovative, engaging, tailored and multilingual tools, learning techniques, and narratives for impactful climate change communication frameworks at scale. Best-practice examples on European and international level should be retrieved. Climate scientists should be trained to effectively communicate with non-specialist audiences, including policymakers and other stakeholders. Research should investigate how to design and implement targeted communication campaigns that boost climate awareness and preparedness while preventing climate anxiety and counteract disinformation. These campaigns should promote fact-checking, clear and transparent knowledge on climate science and climate policymaking and foster the ability to interpret uncertainties. Citizen engagement, of youth and other vulnerable audiences in particular, is encouraged. Actions should develop communication strategies, tools and products tailored to real-world context and societal needs, to counter disinformation and enhance climate communication, leveraging visual and digital tools including AI, as appropriate. They should demonstrate clear pathways for uptake and scaling such as piloting with end-users and integration into existing platforms or frameworks. The primary focus of actions should be on Europe, with local and national foci as appropriate, while other regions may be used for framing information. International cooperation is encouraged, especially with the United States[1] and low- to middle-income countries automatically eligible for Horizon Europe funding [2]. This research requires a multi-faceted, interdisciplinary approach drawing on insights from the natural sciences, social sciences and humanities (SSH) including behavioural sciences and gender, media studies, and communication theory. Participation of the private sector, in particular SME, is also strongly encouraged. All projects funded under this topic are strongly encouraged to collaborate and envisage clustering activities together and with other relevant projects in and outside of Horizon Europe. Collaboration with the EU Missions on Adaptation to Climate Change and on Climate neutral and Smart Cities is recommended when performing empirical work. Proposals should earmark the necessary resources for these purposes. [1] Standard Horizon Europe funding rules apply – legal entities from the USA are not automatically eligible for funding.

Knowledge gaps identified in the EU Climate Risk Assessments (EUCRA)[1] and latest IPCC assessments are narrowed, including system specific, region specific and cross-cutting gaps, so that the future EUCRAs benefit from a significant reduction of current risk assessment limitations and useful knowledge is available for various policymaking contexts. Scope: The development and implementation of climate adaptation strategies and plans of the EU and Member States rely on the most accurate and decision-useful assessments of climate risks that science can provide. For this purpose, the new knowledge feeding future EUCRAs will be essential. In the first EUCRA assessment, a number of gaps in terms of knowledge and action, and corresponding recommendations are highlighted to underpin more effective EU policy intervention to manage climate risks, stressing the importance of a systemic approach to climate risk assessments, adaptation and resilience and of the interaction with non-climate risk drivers, such as biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation among others. To support the future EUCRAs and advance adaptation and climate preparedness, actions should improve the understanding and quantification of climate risks, their underlying drivers, and reduce associated uncertainties for different systems and regions. New knowledge should be integrated to assess the risks of wildcards (high impact low probability or black swan events), crossing of tipping points and transboundary, compound and cascading risks in a way that can facilitate decision-making. Evidence from recent experiences of materialised climate risks and the performance of adaptation efforts, encompassing the whole range from failure to success and including the role of behavioural aspects, should be mapped and analysed to improve understanding of the key factors that determine effective environmental and social resilience, preparedness and adaptation capacity[2]. However, developing context-specific adaptation strategies is out of the scope of this topic. The main focus is tackling knowledge gaps identified in the EUCRA. Actions should extend and improve the evidence base by retrieving inputs from relevant end-users, including local and regional authorities, and civil society organisations. While general aspects should cover the whole EU, actions should also improve understanding of sub-European and national to local specific risks. Actions should enhance methodologies and tools for risk assessment, making the outputs available through user-oriented EU portals. For these purposes, proposals should: Address at least two systems or sectors (e.g. ecosystems, agri-food, health, infrastructures, energy, water, economy and finance) that interact and have transboundary effects. Include study cases at sub-European scale. While all the cases together should cover the 4 regions defined in EUCRA[3], some of the individual cases should also address the transnational dimension (i.e. include more than one country of the particular region). Actions should contribute to future editions of EUCRA. Specific resources should be devoted to this purpose. Actions should leverage recent advances on other climate risk assessments and related frameworks from reliable sources (e.g. the World Climate Research Programme, WCRP). Actions are encouraged to integrate multiple data sources and to leverage digital technologies, such as AI/ML techniques, tools, and models, including those developed under the European Commission’s Destination Earth initiative, if appropriate. Coordination and collaboration with relevant projects from Mission Adaptation, Cluster 5 Destination 1 on Climate Science and Responses is encouraged, especially for evidence retrieval, national to local scale assessment, methodological consistency, and cross-fertilisation through project scientific boards; with projects from Cluster 3 Destination Disaster-Resilient Society for Europe for knowledge exchange and better integration of end-user perspectives, and from relevant Destinations in other Clusters.

In line with the Strategic Plan, the overall expected impact of this Destination is to contribute to the “Advancing science for a transition to a climate-neutral and resilient society”. Expected impacts: Research should contribute to closing major knowledge gaps on the changing climate together with their associated impacts and risks, on both society and nature. It should also help develop tools to support decision-makers in designing and implementing effective mitigation and adaptation actions at various time and spatial scales while properly accounting for synergies and trade-offs with other policy objectives, such as just transition, territorial cohesion and leaving no one behind. The main impacts to be generated by topics under this Destination are: Supporting climate action (both mitigation and adaptation) in Europe and globally, through advancing climate science and the knowledge base underpinning actionable solutions, to accelerate the transition to a climate-neutral, climate-resilient and prosperous society. Closing key knowledge gaps related to climate change, thereby contributing substantially to key European and international assessments such as IPCC, IPBES, EUCRA, and other initiatives such as the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) and the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) under the World Climate Research Programme. Strengthening the European Research Area on climate change by boosting scientific excellence and capacity in an inclusive manner across the participating countries. Maximising synergies between mitigation and adaptation and with other policy priorities such as biodiversity and ecosystem preservation and restoration, disaster-preparedness, digitalisation, circular economy, prosperity and competitiveness, strategic autonomy, security and resilience, just transition, and the Sustainable Development Goals by exploring co-benefits, trade-offs and potential unintended consequences of climate strategies and policy interventions. Important components of climate science research are also addressed in other Clusters -particularly Cluster 6 – which addresses the climate-ocean-cryosphere-polar nexus and the climate-energy-land-food-water-biodiversity nexus. Efforts to foster synergies and complementarities across these research activities are strongly encouraged. Show more Topic conditions and documents General conditions 1.

Ensured applicability and replicability of sustainable and digital strategies at port level for middle and small-size maritime ports and inland ports across all the EU, balancing geography and size. Ensured increased adoption of sustainable waterborne transport practices in ports of all sizes. Sustainable and digital strategies will prepare middle and small-sized ports to enhance their competitiveness with a focus on cost-effective and scalable adaptation measures, increase their climate resilience and biodiversity friendliness, and improve safety for port workers and crews of ships at berth. Sustainable and digital strategies will reduce emissions of GHG, air and water pollutants and other biodiversity impacts from ports, applying innovative solutions for zero-emission and biodiversity friendly port operations and ships at berth. Strategies should be applicable to maritime and inland waterway middle-sized and small-sized ports and located throughout Europe. Contribute to the objectives of the EU Port Strategy. Development of sustainable and digital strategies that not only enhance the competitiveness of middle-sized and small-sized ports but also mitigate health risks for populations in port areas. Scope: Ports are important multimodal hubs in the supply chain, linking the sea with the hinterland, evolving into critical hubs and facilitators of sustainable energies, are clusters of industry and circular economy, as well as geo-political and geo-economic resilience. Europe needs ports that are competitive and sustainable on local, regional and global levels, and the Competitiveness Compass calls for a new strategy to highlight the role that European ports will play in the future EU economy. The Green Deal aims to achieve climate neutrality by 2050 and to reverse the degradation of ecosystems by 2030. The EU Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy[1] (SSMS) states that infrastructure must be adapted to climate change, less biodiversity harmful and made resilient to disasters. In line with the SSMS, it is also important that ports can provide increasing volumes of clean and decarbonised energy sources, notably renewable energy, and on a modernised grid. Proposals are expected to address all the following aspects: Identify innovative technologies, as well as results from EU-funded research, innovation and deployment projects and other technological, economic and social best practices. Consider mature technologies ready to be deployed in middle and small-sized ports across the EU contributing to the expected outcomes. Address challenges and opportunities for the implementation and/or for commercial deployment of these solutions in small and medium-sized maritime ports and inland waterway ports located throughout the EU. Developing strategies contributing to the expected outcomes for middle and small ports across the EU following a geographical balance, contributing to the objectives of the EU Ports Strategy. Design and demonstrate integrated smart energy systems and grids for port and waterborne transport operations, including energy production, storage and OPS operations, covering the needs for electrification and charging of port terminal equipment, and modes of transport connecting the port to the hinterland, such road transport, nearby industry and buildings) to make the solutions more energy- and cost-effective. Develop climate resilience strategies of middle and small size ports and their infrastructure, including adaptation measures to address sea-level rise, extreme weather events, and other climate-related risks, with a focus on cost-effective and scalable solutions (such as nature-based solutions), building on best practices developed in EU-funded research projects. Analyse how VTMIS and port community systems can be developed and exploited to their full potential, harmonizing functionalities whenever possible, paving the way to automatic shipping. Consider possible linkages to eMSW and eFTI. Apply digital standards and common semantics which enable the harmonisation of collection and analysis of GHG and pollutant emissions at small and medium sized TEN-T ports network. When developing digital solutions proposals should consider cybersecurity implications and develop solutions that assess and manage vulnerabilities in IT and OT systems, establish robust incident response plans, implement strong access control measures, network and supply chain security, in line with EU standards such as the NIS Directive and the Cybersecurity Act and with the goal of achieving resilience and redundancy. Explore long-term workforce requirements for zero-emission, climate-resilient, biodiversity friendly, safe and competitive port operations, ensuring continuous knowledge transfer between universities, vocational training providers and industry. Develop a R&I roadmap for solutions of EU and EEA ports to address the areas covered under the expected outcomes, taking into consideration 2035 as an intermediate milestone and 2050 as the final one. Explore, with competent authorities and stakeholders, how environmental aspects related to zero pollution and circular economy for ports as well as maritime and inland waterway vessels can be improved in an environmentally and economically sustainable way (through reception facilities, degassing facilities, OPS...), in line with the ambition expressed in i.a. NAIADES III, SUMPs, local or regional Air Quality Plans and Waste Management Plans. Collaborate with industry stakeholders and regulatory bodies to align project outcomes with EU policy objectives, particularly the Port Strategy. Explore cooperation between ports, as well as stronger horizontal networking, to increase the efficiency of undertakings and improve the integration of European ports. Evaluate the financial implications of proposed solutions and identify possible strategies and tools for financing/funding as well as business models that go beyond request of public support. Solutions at project level must be demonstrated in at least six medium and small-sized TEN-T ports ensuring a geographical balance, of which five are maritime ports and one inland. Not all solution must necessarily be demonstrated in all ports. Proposals are expected to explain the contribution of their objectives, results, IP management and exploitation strategy to the EU added value creation and strategic autonomy throughout the supply and value chain, including competitiveness of the EU waterborne industry, enhancement of the EU’s R&I capacity, technological know-how capabilities and human capital, and resilience of the EU industrial and manufacturing base.

Demonstrated efficient integration of HD-BEV in logistics fleets and operations along several European corridor segments, building further on the initial fleet developed in the large-scale demonstrations and across several types of transport operators. Reinforced ecosystem connecting involved parties as fleet operators, charge providers, road authorities at local, regional, national and European levels – also reinforcing the industrial HD-BEV value chain in the EU. Scope: The implementation of zero emission vehicles for long-distance heavy-duty freight transport is of key importance to meet the European targets reducing greenhouse gas and air pollutants emissions. To further accelerate HD-BEV integration in logistic fleets and operations it is essential to identify and address the remaining barriers and challenges of their deployment. These barriers can be related to e.g. limitations in vehicle technology, digital tools, knowledge and user awareness, stakeholder engagement, energy and power availability, charging infrastructure needs such as depot charging and Megawatt Charging System (MCS), permit processes and connection to the grid and services. The challenges for logistics companies’ (also smaller operators) implementing zero emission transport solutions need to be addressed. Proposed actions are expected to address all of the following aspects: Perform large-scale demonstrations of HD BEV equipped with MCS reaching up to a hundred market-ready vehicles and new generation vehicles in logistics fleets operations, involving several transport operators also engaging SMEs and microenterprises, focussing on long-haul operation (average ≥600km operations) during extended durations of over twelve months. The demonstrations must cover at least four European corridors’ segments in at least four Member States (MS) and/or Associated Countries (AC), and involved HD BEV should where possible be also equipped with MCS connector. Identify and address the barriers and challenges to accelerate the deployment of fleets of HD-BEV in long-distance logistics operations in Europe, considering also the impact of battery degradation and the weather conditions in all seasons. Develop and integrate in the demonstrations the use of digital tools with use of AI, access to data sets, operational and governance logistics models including charging opportunities and models to facilitate increasing numbers of HD-BEVs in logistics operations Ensure synergies with the existing publicly accessible charging infrastructure available or funded under the CEF and/or other national/regional funding schemes and assess charging methods and business models for long-haul operations such as depot, destination, truck-stops, overnight etc., using different charging power considering cost and time optimisation. Only depot charging (mono and/or multi-operator) infrastructure can be (partially) funded in demonstration projects, including related innovative business models associated such as smart, bidirectional V2X solutions and possible second life of batteries. Develop a competition-compliant ecosystem for sharing data for HD-BEV fleet management in so-called data labs including data pooling, which can include publication of open and FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable) data, and which could build on the common European mobility data space, also supporting the dissemination best practices, learnings and capacity building mechanisms as levers for HD-BEV acceleration. Using the shared data, new services and tools can be developed, including AI-based tools, agents and model frameworks for fleet management, both for on-board and remote monitoring. Define and test use cases for the use of HD-BEV fleets in long-distance logistics operations for cross-border flows, operational strategies to shift freight transport demand to zero-emission solutions, and collaborative business model(s). Establish synergies and leverage with previous and ongoing projects related to HD-BEV and charging systems and with related forums, platforms and programmes, such as with the European Clean Corridors Initiative, as part of the Automotive Action Plan.[1] Map and assess how policies and relevant legislation (including incentives) can support an affordable transition to HD-BEV. Identify and address, by providing recommendations, remaining legal and regulatory barriers encountered in the demonstrations. An analysis of the potential economic, social and environmental benefits (notably greenhouse gas and air pollutants emissions reduction) must be included in the demonstrations. This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Towards zero emission road transport’ (2ZERO).

Improve knowledge on the risks posed by the introduction of renewable low zero-carbon fuels. A review of existing regulations, standards, and guidelines, for all EU Member States, with recommendations for updates, harmonisation or new regulations as needed. Define operational improvements required to enhance safety in storage, handling and bunkering of renewable low and zero-carbon fuels. Development of a strategy for skills development for port personnel and stakeholders involved in the handling, storage, and bunkering of renewable low and zero-carbon fuels, ensuring safe and efficient operations. Scope: The rapid transition to low and zero-carbon solutions in maritime and inland waterborne transport requires port authorities and stakeholders to swiftly adapt to supply large quantities of renewable low and zero-carbon fuels and electricity. However, this shift poses new safety challenges, particularly in port areas where multiple bunkering operations, import/export terminals, and fuel handling and storage activities coexist. The close location of most ports to cities and inhabited areas raises issues of safety on two fronts: the space deficit due to the difficulty of enlarging the port areas in these locations, (leading to e.g. the storage of various fuels in close proximity), and the broader danger to these inhabited areas due to their proximity to the ports and by extension the storage of these fuels. To ensure a safe and efficient energy transition, it is crucial to assess and mitigate the risks associated with the introduction of renewable low and zero-carbon fuels in port areas. As not all ports will be able to store every type of clean fuel in the port or neighbouring area, safety of transport and distribution within the port area (including anchorage) should also be analysed. Existing EU legislation regarding specifically the safety of port workers is limited. The Directive on the safe loading and unloading of bulk carriers (2001/96/EC) sets out the EU requirements which increase safety procedures for bulk carriers loading and unloading their solid cargo in EU ports. Further instruments such as the Directive on port State control (2009/16/EC) and the Directive on the investigation of accidents in the maritime transport sector (2009/18/EC, recently amended), while related to safety in the maritime sector, do not apply to the safety of port workers specifically. Broader instruments such as the EU Occupational Safety and Health Framework Directive (89/391/EEC) and the Directive on the Minimum Safety and Health Requirements for the Use of Work Equipment by Workers at Work (2009/104/EC), while applicable to port workers due to their general character, miss the intricacies needed to address the specific risks of workers in this sector. This issue is further exacerbated by the fact that port workers are being exposed to new risks due to the rising use of renewable low and zero-carbon fuels in the maritime sector and the need for safe bunkering and storage of these fuels in port areas. Given the above it is important to have a clear picture of the current status regarding the storage and bunkering of fuels across EU ports, identify existing and applicable legislation, map gaps and potential risks and make appropriate recommendations for follow-up actions. Proposals are expected to address all the following aspects: Conduct a comprehensive review of the risks associated with the introduction of renewable low and zero-carbon fuels within (inland and sea) the port areas, including distribution, simultaneous bunkering operations, import/export terminals, handling and storage of fuels. Analyse gaps in existing regulations, standards, and guidelines relevant to the safe handling and storage of renewable low and zero-carbon fuels, in maritime and inland TEN-T ports. Identify safety risks not adequately addressed by current rules and risk assessments, including Hazard Identification (HAZID) and Quantitative Risk Assessments (QRA) taking into account - inter-alia - gas dispersion, fire/explosion impacts and their probabilities using F-N curves. Develop guidelines and recommendations to ensure safe operations (considering environmental and health aspects) per fuel type in port areas, considering varying port sizes, services (including technical-nautical vessels), locations, and geographies, especially for ports located in populated areas including establishing safety zones. International rules, standards and guidelines should be taken into consideration (especially from the IMO and the IHPA where relevant). Relevant environmental Plans required by EU or national legislation such as Air Quality Plans should be considered. Develop standard risk assessment criteria for groups of ports with similar characteristics, operational and weather conditions by researching and establishing standard criteria for risk assessments in port planning and development. This includes defining safety-by-design procedures for new port infrastructures and bunkering operations. Engage with relevant stakeholders, including port authorities, terminal operators, shipping companies, trade unions and regulatory bodies, to ensure the practicality and effectiveness of the developed guidelines and recommendations. Additionally, a strategy for skills development should be presented, associating social partners and civil society where relevant. This strategy should include the design and implementation of comprehensive training modules tailored to various roles within port operations, focusing on the specific safety protocols and procedures associated with renewable low and zero-carbon fuels. Propose certification and continuous professional development pathways to maintain high safety standards and adapt to evolving technologies and regulations. This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Zero Emission Waterborne Transport’ (ZEWT). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on results to the European Partnership ‘Zero Emission Waterborne Transport’ (ZEWT) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.","General information Programme Horizon Europe (HORIZON) Call MOBILITY (HORIZON-CL5-2026-05) Type of action HORIZON-CSA HORIZON Coordination and Support Actions Type of MGA HORIZON Lump Sum Grant [HORIZON-AG-LS] Open For Submission Deadline model single-stage Opening date 18 December 2025 Deadline date 14 April 2026 17:00:00 Brussels time Topic description Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all the following expected outcomes: A comprehensive risk assessment of the introduction of renewable low and zero-carbon waterborne fuels, in maritime and inland port areas.

Demonstration of improved shipyard manufacturing processes in small and medium-size shipyards, capable of building waterborne vessels in the EU/EEA. Reduced complexity to perform future retrofits of vessels and enabling the later inclusion of several emissions saving technologies and solutions. Higher capability and efficiency of European shipyards and equipment manufacturers to meet the increasing need to convert the shipping fleet towards zero-emission and biodiversity friendly maritime transport. Making the shipbuilding and retrofitting industry better prepared for building and replicating low-to-zero emission ships. Scope: European shipbuilding industry is facing increasing pressure from international players, and there is a need to improve its competitiveness through innovation and technological advancements. The MARI-4YARD project together with RESURGAM, FIBRE4YARDS, SMARTYards and PENELOPE developed several solutions on materials, processes, AI and skills. Additionally, the project SEUS in Horizon Europe is developing an integrated software platform with the ambition to save time in engineering, assembly and construction at European shipyards. However, there is still a need to increase the ambition and demonstrate these solutions in medium and small-size shipyards. At the same time, shipyards are often located in sensitive natural areas, such as coastal regions and estuaries. This provides an opportunity for shipyards to evaluate and reduce their impact on the surrounding biodiversity. The topic aims to improve efficiency and sustainability of European ship newbuilding and retrofitting processes, to improve the use of resources and circularity, to develop necessary skills and improve working conditions. This requires considering all relevant innovations such as robotics, automation, digitalization and AI in the context of shipbuilding to enhance EU/EEA -focused value chains. The purpose is to increase the competitiveness of the European shipbuilding sector with a view to further replicating and utilizing results, including in potential applications to the Innovation Fund. Proposals are expected to address all the following aspects: Deployment and integration of innovative technologies and systems in small and medium-size EU and EEA shipyards to enhance the competitiveness and sustainability of newbuild, repair and retrofit processes and process chains. Pilot applications should consider all aspects of the shipbuilding process (including technological, business-related and organizational aspects), equipment, and ship design, potentially including: a) automation and robotics in shipbuilding processes; b) advanced digitalization in design and production; c) innovations in retrofitting and predictive maintenance of shipbuilding assets; circular economy in all relevant processes (construction, repairs, retrofitting and dismantling). Pilot applications should also consider systems interoperability and integration with existing shipyard infrastructure, tools and equipment. Explore advanced ways of digital collaboration (co-simulation, sharing digital data) while considering cyber security, to improve synergies within value chains, including equipment manufacturers, shipyards, ship designers and shipowners. Testing and physical demonstration of the developed technologies in real life shipyard ecosystem and as much as possible in relation with full scale ship building, including benchmarking of existing practices and consideration of environmental impacts and potential safety improvements for workers. Demonstrations should take place in at least three EU/EEA shipyards. Develop biodiversity friendly strategies, integrating nature-based solutions on site, promoting circularity and sustainability of processes. Additionally, a strategy for skills development should be presented, associating social partners and civil society where relevant. Propose measures to solidify the current strengths of smaller and medium-sized shipyards across Europe, with a focus on increasing competitiveness and growth, reinforcing and growing European shipyards and improving environmental performance. For exploitation purposes, proposals should: a) develop business plans and rollout strategies, including measures to reduce knowledge and technology leakage outside of Europe; b) identify clear target groups (vessel types, segments and processes) and their current state, deficiencies and improvement needs, and make a clear exploitation strategy on how to roll out the results to end-users. Proposals are expected to explain the contribution of their objectives, results, IP management and exploitation strategy to the EU added value creation and strategic autonomy throughout the supply and value chain, including competitiveness of the EU waterborne industry, enhancement of the EU’s R&I capacity, technological know-how capabilities and human capital, and resilience of the EU industrial and manufacturing base.

There is reduced reliance on external expertise, increased representation of African science and scientists in international bodies such as the IPCC and UNFCCC, and enhanced African contribution to global climate initiatives such as CMIP, CORDEX and ISIMIP. Scope: Africa is among the regions most severely affected by climate change, mostly due to high vulnerability and low adaptive capacity. While significant advancements in global weather and climate science have transformed resilience efforts elsewhere, their benefits in Africa remain to be harnessed, to unlock the continent’s ability to address climate challenges more effectively. Actions should address critical knowledge gaps for improving weather and climate modelling for Africa in the context of changing climate, with focus on the understanding and representation of weather and climate dynamics in Africa at regional, interregional or continental scale. They should enhance models’ predictive skill and reduce uncertainties in key areas such as rainfall and extreme weather events. Actions should harness observational data to advance process-based understanding and model performance across various Earth System components (e.g. land, ocean, atmosphere). This includes improving data collection, assimilation and quality assurance practices, integration of local and rescued historical data to provide high-quality inputs for models. Actions are encouraged to leverage digital technologies, including AI/ML techniques, tools, and models as well as advances in high performance computing to achieve the topic’s goals. The research should be performed in close cooperation and co-creation between African and European teams in a way to ensure relevance, acceptance and co-ownership of solutions by African stakeholders. Actions are also expected to contribute to local capacity-building and knowledge exchange to support competence growth and equip African researchers with the data, tools and expertise necessary to sustain future progress. Strong partnerships should be established between relevant institutions in both regions such as universities, research bodies, National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHSs) and African Regional Climate Centers (RCCs)[3] to enable mutual learning and collaborations. Synergies and complementarity should be sought with other relevant EU-supported initiatives on climate modelling and capacity development in Africa such as Regional Centres of Excellence related to the green transition[4]. Additionally, actions should facilitate access of African researchers to cutting-edge European research infrastructures including supercomputing assets and data repositories to strengthen institutional and regional expertise and capacity.

Expected impacts: Research should contribute to closing major knowledge gaps on the changing climate together with their associated impacts and risks, on both society and nature. It should also help develop tools to support decision-makers in designing and implementing effective mitigation and adaptation actions at various time and spatial scales while properly accounting for synergies and trade-offs with other policy objectives, such as just transition, territorial cohesion and leaving no one behind. The main impacts to be generated by topics under this Destination are: Supporting climate action (both mitigation and adaptation) in Europe and globally, through advancing climate science and the knowledge base underpinning actionable solutions, to accelerate the transition to a climate-neutral, climate-resilient and prosperous society. Closing key knowledge gaps related to climate change, thereby contributing substantially to key European and international assessments such as IPCC, IPBES, EUCRA, and other initiatives such as the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) and the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) under the World Climate Research Programme. Strengthening the European Research Area on climate change by boosting scientific excellence and capacity in an inclusive manner across the participating countries. Maximising synergies between mitigation and adaptation and with other policy priorities such as biodiversity and ecosystem preservation and restoration, disaster-preparedness, digitalisation, circular economy, prosperity and competitiveness, strategic autonomy, security and resilience, just transition, and the Sustainable Development Goals by exploring co-benefits, trade-offs and potential unintended consequences of climate strategies and policy interventions. Important components of climate science research are also addressed in other Clusters -particularly Cluster 6 – which addresses the climate-ocean-cryosphere-polar nexus and the climate-energy-land-food-water-biodiversity nexus. Efforts to foster synergies and complementarities across these research activities are strongly encouraged. Show more Topic conditions and documents General conditions 1.

Scope: Climate monitoring of Essential Climate Variables[1] at global and regional scales is crucial to assess the state of our climate, its variability and change, and to track progress towards the goals of the Paris Agreement and the corresponding EU climate objectives. Underlying elements, in particular climate data records, reanalyses and forcings, are fundamental to climate science and serve multiple applications across weather, climate, environmental and sectoral domains, generating societal benefits. In turn, methods to distil information from this wealth of data can help extract relevant knowledge and key messages for climate policymaking. Proposals are expected to address only one of the following priority areas, which should be clearly indicated: A. Next generation climate data records Actions should advance innovative methods to enhance, expand and update climate data records; exploit recently rescued and/or new data streams; develop innovative methods to improve the water-energy-carbon cycle physical and bio-geochemical consistency across data records; and improve their applicability for users. B. Next generation Earth system reanalyses Actions should undertake research to prepare for the next generation global and European high resolution climate reanalyses. Progress is expected in enhanced data assimilation methods, further coupling the Earth system components, expanding atmospheric composition reanalysis backward in time, piloting carbon-energy-water cycle reanalyses, exploring data-driven methods for reanalyses and applying such improvements in subsequent applications and international initiatives. C. Next generation climate forcing and emission data sets Actions are expected to conduct research to ensure more updated and sustained production, and quality assurance procedures of climate forcings and emissions data sets in support of international climate change assessments and climate simulations, including harmonization between forcing and emission data sets (historical and scenarios). Additionally, all actions should promote the development and use of new, rescued or proxy data streams, and innovative digital tools and methods, including AI-based, to transform climate data into actionable knowledge. These efforts should align with, build upon, and support global intercomparison and coordination frameworks such as CMIP, promoting standardisation, accessibility and utility of climate information across climate science and service user communities, with due consideration of FAIR principles. Noting the current divestment of the US in climate and environmental related monitoring networks, which may severely impact climate research and services worldwide, proposers are requested to dedicate resources to the assessment and mitigation of such impacts towards increased resilience of climate monitoring at European and global scale. Research areas of particular interest include new data mining capabilities to facilitate the identification of events and areas of interest, anomalous climate behaviours, unexpected trends, etc. within those data sets. Equally welcome are methods to automate regular and consistent climate reporting along agreed climate indicators, to distil useful climate information (i.e. climate intelligence), and to derive knowledge tailored to relevant users (e.g. for sectoral applications and assessment such as biodiversity monitoring and ecosystem management), from expert users to policy makers and the general public.

Show more Further information Introduction REINFORCING supports organizations and institutions in Europe in transitioning to a new paradigm where responsibility and openness drive research and innovation (R&I) processes. Green and digital transitions have become of paramount importance to address the societal challenges that European societies currently face. The twin transition will bring enormous benefits but also undesired externalities and implications. In this regard, EU institutions and territories need to shift to more open and transparent R&I practices in which all actors share responsibility to develop services and products that are acceptable, sustainable, and bring social satisfaction. The Open and Responsible Research and Innovation (ORRI) approach promotes collaborative efforts, sharing research outputs as early as possible for engaging citizens in co-creation processes and opening R&I to the whole society. Implementing Open and Responsible Research and Innovation (ORRI) can seem a daunting task. Over the past decade, many resources and tools have been created, but an effort to systematize, curate, and create a single-entry point was still missing. REINFORCING is this much-needed European central hub for ORRI. The REINFORCING platform is the entry point to knowledge, training, ORRI skills matchmaking, and capacity building for organizations interested in starting or continuing their journey to creating an inclusive R&I ecosystem. Furthermore, the project brokers unique networking opportunities for organizations, institutions, and territories interested in becoming part of the European ecosystem that is transforming the R&I system by bringing it closer to society and societal needs. To support this change, REINFORCING has ring-fenced funding to invite institutions from around Europe to develop projects aiming at implementing new modes of doing R&I that drive more just transitions. All the Calls have supported and will support territories and organizations experimenting with ORRI for the first time (ORRI Incubator Open Calls) as well as those scaling up their ORRI activities (ORRI Booster Open Calls). Call requirements and details Eligible applicants should demonstrate proven experience with ORRI practices and a strong commitment to institutionalizing these approaches within their organization or territory. Exceptionally and only for this Call, although this is a Booster Call with all the standard features of a Booster Call (maximum grant of €20,000, a project duration of 8 months, no requirement for a mandatory small consortium of two applicants, no ORRI training or mentoring services provided by the REINFORCING consortium, and only a final report required), applications from ORRI newcomers are also welcome. However, please note that in the event of an ex aequo ranking, applicants with prior ORRI experience will be prioritized. The REINFORCING Seventh Open Call, as a Booster Call, has specific and mandatory requirements to comply with: Release an ORRI resource (or ORRI Tool) to be inserted into the REINFORCING online platform. The resource should be included in the proposal text as one of the results to be delivered and its development in the list of activities to be performed. Attend the online internal 7th REINFORCING Open Call Kick-off meeting and online monthly meetings with the 7th REINFORCING Open Call Coordinator and REINFORCING consortium representatives. Take part in the online 7th Open Call mid-term review meeting. Join the online internal 7th REINFORCING Open Call Final Event. Participate in the public 7th REINFORCING Open Call Webinar at the end of the project. Contribute to the online communication and update of the REINFORCING project channels (e.g., website, social media, etc.) with grantees' achievements and information. Engage in peer learning activities.

Task description Responsible Security Open Call Description Europe is facing a rapidly evolving security landscape shaped by geopolitical tensions, technological disruptions, and societal transformations. In this context, the role of R&I in safeguarding security, democratic values, ethical standards, and societal resilience is more critical than ever. This open call supports organizations and institutions across Europe in exploring and implementing new modes of conducting R&I that respond to security-related challenges with responsibility, openness, and societal alignment. The call promotes the ORRI framework as the guiding approach to addressing the transformative security challenges facing Europe. It invites applicants to develop projects that foster collaboration between researchers, policymakers, civil society, and citizens to co-create solutions to enhance European security through innovative projects that explore and address the evolving landscape of European security with a particular emphasis on the principles of ORRI. This call seeks to support ORRI practices and related social and organizational innovations that address, or are inspired by, the following questions: Securitization of science and technology: How are scientific practices and innovations being developed within national and European security emphasizing policies and practices? How can we, in practice, balance securitization with openness, collaboration, and ethical standards? Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI): How can RRI frameworks be practically applied or adapted to security-related research and innovation domains? What mechanisms could help ensure acceptability and societal engagement in security-driven innovation? Policy, governance and organizational models: What new governance and organizational approaches are needed to simultaneously support security, research, innovation, and ethics? Applicants should tackle one or more of these challenges, or propose other relevant topics related to ORRI and EU securitization, providing justification for their selection in the application process. All projects should aim to contribute to a more inclusive, transparent, and ethically grounded European security R&I ecosystem. Potential Activities Projects applying to this call may include, but are not limited to, the following activities: Designing and implementing co-creation processes with citizens, civil society, or vulnerable groups to explore the societal impacts of dual-use technology (e.g., surveillance, AI, biotechnology). Developing training and dialogue workshops for researchers and innovators working in security or domains to embed RRI principles in their work. Establishing participatory foresight or scenario workshops to anticipate ethical and societal risks of emerging security-related research and innovation as well as dual-use technology. Start creating institutionally stable mechanisms (e.g., ethical review boards, socially responsible licensing) to manage the development and deployment of security research and/or dual-use technology in research institutions. Piloting citizen engagement models (e.g., citizen juries, deliberative panels) to inform national or regional security research agendas and policies. Applying the Societal Readiness Thinking Tool to align innovation trajectories with societal values and mitigate unintended consequences of security-focused research. Interdisciplinary and cross-sectoral collaboration is strongly encouraged. Projects must be based in or have relevance to the European context."

The Competitiveness Compass announces initiatives that should be served directly by industry-linked activities in Cluster 4, through new, focused R&I activities, but also through the activities supported up to now: Clean Industrial Deal adopted in February 2025; Critical Raw Materials Act; Advanced Materials Communication and future Advanced Materials Act planned for 2026; Future Circular Economy Act planned for 2026; Steel and Metals Action Plan adopted in March 2025; European Chemicals Industry Action Plan adopted in July 2025; Industrial action plan for the European automotive sector adopted in March 2025; and Strategy on research and technology infrastructures, with regard to technology infrastructures and the valorisation of knowledge. In order to better translate these policy priorities into actions, to integrate the latest inputs from the partnerships, and to achieve synergies, this Work Programme part adopts a more integrated approach. The headings used under the two industry-focused destinations in previous work programmes, reflecting different partnerships and industrial sectors, are replaced by new headings making strongly interconnected contributions to the corresponding expected impacts in the Strategic Plan 2025-27, on green and digital transition and on autonomy in raw and advanced materials. The new approach takes into account R&I investments under previous work programmes and intends to introduce more synergies with other pillars (notably the European Innovation Council under Pillar III) as well as with Cluster 5. Topics in this Work Programme increasingly combine the priorities of different partnerships to enable synergies, e.g. with the Investment fund, while continuing to address the particularities of each partnership. The development of new and cross-cutting technologies will help transform existing value chains and create new ones. In addition to this Work Programme part, Cluster 4 participates in a horizontal Clean Industrial Deal Call, aiming to increase the competitiveness and decarbonisation of industry. The initiative will allow Horizon Europe beneficiaries to feed the EU deployment pipeline with R&I solutions close to market uptake and deployment, whilst also supporting the development by 2035 of a new batch of industry-led demonstrators designed for higher market readiness. In addition to decarbonisation, manufacturing and energy-intensive industries need to embrace the circular economy as a key pillar in the design of their value chains. This will be fundamental to their resource efficiency (in terms of materials, energy and water). Particularly important in this context is the upcycling of secondary raw materials and waste; de- and re-manufacturing; and the development of sustainable and resource-efficient industrial processes This Work Programme continues to promote across the calls the application of Safe and Sustainable by Design approach incorporating early and parallel considerations of innovation design choices on impacts on health, environment, climate and other sustainability parameters as a way of achieving stated policy objectives and fostering quick market uptake. Where projects are asked to contribute to the development of safe and sustainable products, projects should take into account safety concerns for consumers as well as the organisational health and safety aspects for industrial workers. Finally, to support start-ups and scale-ups, this Work Programme includes support for technology infrastructures and valorisation of knowledge. Business cases and exploitation strategies for industrialisation: This section applies only to those topics in this Destination, for which proposals should demonstrate the expected outcomes by including a business case and exploitation strategy for industrialisation. A business case and a credible initial exploitation strategy are essential components in the ultimate success of an industry-based project, as well as its prospects to attract further investments for deployment. They will both be decisive factors under the impact criterion, and proposers are encouraged to use the extended page limit to present a carefully considered business case and exploitation strategy, backed by the management of the companies involved. The business case should demonstrate the expected impact of the proposal in terms of enhanced market opportunities for the participants and deployment in the EU, in the short to medium term. It should describe the targeted market(s); estimated market size in the EU and globally; user and customer needs; and demonstrate that the solutions will match the market and user needs in a cost-effective manner; and describe the expected market position and competitive advantage. The exploitation strategy should identify obstacles, requirements and necessary actions involved in reaching higher TRLs (Technology Readiness Levels), for example: securing the required investments, including through possible synergies with other programmes; accessing the required skills; matching value chains; enhancing product robustness; securing industrial integrators; and user acceptance. For TRLs 6 and 7, a credible strategy to achieve future full-scale deployment in the EU is expected, indicating the intentions of the industrial partners after the end of the project. Where relevant, in the context of skills, it is recommended to develop training material to endow workers with the right skillset in order to support the uptake and deployment of new innovative products, services, and processes developed in the different projects. This material should be tested and be scalable, and can potentially be up-scaled through the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+). This will help the European labour force to close the skill gaps in the relevant sectors and occupational groups and improve employment and social levels across the EU and associated countries. Where projects are asked to contribute to the development of safe and sustainable products, projects should take into account safety concerns for consumers and the organisational health and safety aspects for industrial workers.
