They will support their creativity, exposing them to project-based research and training, and connect them to the wider community of research organisations and industry players. Each competition will centre around a challenge addressing a highly relevant societal or industrial challenge that has been developed by a consortium of Europe’s most prestigious research institutes and industry partners. The consortia will work in close cooperation with the respective Sectoral digital skills academies and Initiatives to ensure buy in and support from the relevant stakeholders in the ecosystem.The competitions will take place in the EU. To launch the competitions, teams of students will compete in six digital areas, represented by the newly established Sectoral digital skills academies, the Destination Earth initiative and an additional area to be chosen by the consortium. Furthermore, it is expected that the competitions will lead to greater innovation, which will allow to measure and compare progress towards the ambitious goals set under each challenge.Scope:The scope of this topic is to develop six challenges for the European Digital Skills Competitions in the four digital areas corresponding to the Sectoral digital skills academies (Quantum, GenAI, Chips, Virtual Worlds), the Destination Earth Initiative (see topic 4.2 of the DEP Work Programme 2025-2027) and one additional area to be developed by the consortium.The challenges will be designed to target three clear objectives: each will address a European societal-, technological or industrial-relevant challenge, attract a large participation of students and help them develop their skills, and raise their awareness and understanding of team and project-based work as well as applied research and innovation in the respective digital technologies. Special attention will also be given to design local and major tournaments. The consortium will also design attractive prize schemes and award for the best challenges from the six areas.The selected project will cooperate closely with the Sectoral digital skills academies, the Destination Earth sectoral Initiative and the respective industrial communities for the design of the competitions. It will as well collaborate with the European League of Advanced Digital Skills Academies (see section 4.3 of the DEP Work Programme 2025-2027) for dissemination, communication and public relations purposes concerning these competitions. Synergies should also be sought with other relevant initiatives, e.g. the Digital Education Hackathon.Show more Topic descriptionExpected Outcome:Deliverables:Well defined, up to date and relevant challenges that will serve as the challenges for the European Advanced Digital Skills CompetitionsCompetitions rule book for participants and juryCompetitions implementation roadmapImplementation and roll-out of the six competitionsSustainability plans for the proposed competitions after the end of the project Objective:The European Advanced Digital Skills Competitions will serve as catalysts for engaging young European people in cutting edge digital technologies.

Objective:The Commission has set ambitious targets in the Digital Decade Policy Programme of reaching 20 million ICT professionals employed in Europe, while promoting access of women to this field, by 2030. Effective collaboration among stakeholders in advanced digital skills is crucial for this investment to bear fruit and to reach the Digital Decade target. An umbrella action at European level, the European League of Advanced Digital Skills Academies, will spearhead this effort by federating existing sectoral initiatives (e.g. the Cybersecurity Skills Academy and the EuroHPC Virtual Training Academy), the newly created sectoral digital skills academies (see topic 4.1 of the DEP Work Programme 2025-2027) and other EU-funded projects focusing on advanced digital skills (notably the DIGITAL-funded higher (specialised) education programmes), fostering synergies with related initiatives like the Digital Largescale Partnership under the New Pact for Skills and the European Digital Education Hub. It will leverage platforms such as the Digital Skills and Jobs Platform to create a cohesive ecosystem. ELEVATE’s vision is to empower stakeholders through coordination, capacity building, communication, and market analysis, driving collective achievement in advanced digital skills.A special emphasis of the League will be on the development and piloting of a mechanism to provide a seal of quality/accreditation of excellence for training modules offered by existing or upcoming sectoral academies and initiatives.Scope:Initiatives such as the Cybersecurity Skills Academy and the four academies (see topic 4.1 of the DEP work Programme 2025-2027) tackle the shortage of ICT specialists in a specific area, highlighting critical issues. The League aims to enhance coordination and collaboration among sectoral initiatives and projects, fostering synergies and a collective approach to minimize fragmentation risks.The European League of Advanced Digital Skills Academies will be structured around four pillars: Coordination and collaboration among sectoral academies, sectoral initiatives and individual projects in advanced digital skills aimed at pooling resources and expertise. Using the Digital Skills and Jobs Platform, this effort will lead to (a) improved sharing of information and best practices, facilitating mutual learning and staying updated of developments, (b) enhanced stakeholder collaboration, including seeking partnerships and advocating for policy changes, (c) unified advocacy for systemic improvements, such as the provision of European joint degrees and micro-credentials in advanced digital skills and (d) strengthened networking and community building, fostering a sense of shared identity among initiatives.Capacity building activities will complement the training offer of the sectoral academies and sectoral initiatives, for example through implementing cross-sectoral mentoring programmes. Furthermore, the League will help developing a framework for a certification mechanism of modular learning credentials for advanced digital skills and support the sectoral academies/initiatives in implementing it. The certification of other existing trainings at European level through the League will be explored, closely with Member States, in line with the 2022 Council Recommendation on a European approach to micro-credentials1.

Objective:Aligned with the previous WP, this action aims to support the continued uptake and further expansion of the data space for manufacturing. The primary objective is to develop legal, technical and business solutions to pool sufficient data and enable authorized AI developers to have direct or indirect data access to train generative AI models specifically for the manufacturing sector. This initiative seeks to reinforce the role of the data space for manufacturing as a major productivity enhancement and collaboration mechanism within the EU.Scope:This initiative will support up to three data-collection projects, with around EUR 3 million co-funding from Digital Europe each, focused on manufacturing use cases to unlock advanced AI models, for example, predictive maintenance, process automation, supply chain management, product design and development and sustainability in production, and increase productivity in industrial environments such as purchases, logistics, resource planning and production halls. These projects aim to collect massive, high-quality data from real industrial environments, ensuring proper labelling where relevant, that could be used to train or finetune generative AI models for the manufacturing sector. The data collection has to be relevant for developing AI applications that can significantly benefit major EU manufacturing sectors (such as automotive, chemical, aeronautics and energy-intensive industries). The project proposal has to clearly identify the target sectors, the stakeholders, and have preliminary agreements about the intended data exchange.The data-collection projects will develop both technical and business solutions to enable authorized AI developers to have direct or indirect data access and utilize these large datasets while fully respecting the data holders' control over their data.Each data-collection project should propose clear use cases to ensure alignment with real-world needs and challenges. Ideally, the AI developers interested in using such data should be already identified in the proposal.The proposal will also ensure technical and legal solutions to make the generated datasets available to users of AI Factories. This will also enable AI Factories to leverage these datasets for the development of AI applications. To this extent, the inclusion of AI Factories in the project will be considered an advantage.Consortia are encouraged to use data intermediaries, as outlined in Chapter III of the Data Governance Act, or other appropriate mechanisms to manage the secure access to and processing of these datasets.The initiative must also work in close partnership with the Data Spaces Support Centre to ensure alignment and interoperability with the broader ecosystem of data spaces implemented with the support of the Digital Europe Programme. Additionally, the action must coordinate with AI Factories to ensure that the datasets generated can be effectively used in conjunction with data already available facilitating in this way collaborative approaches for the development of advanced AI models.Considering financial sustainability from the outset is crucial in the development of Common European Data Spaces to ensure their long-term viability and effectiveness. By establishing a sound financial model, developers can secure the resources necessary to adapt to evolving technological landscapes and user needs, ensuring that data spaces remain robust and beneficial over time.Show more Topic descriptionExpected Outcome:Deliverables The awarded proposals are expected to deliver: Solutions that allow the collection of large, high-quality data from real industrial environments, from different manufacturing systems/sectors.Solutions that allow access to these large datasets to train Generative AI models that respond to real-world industrial needs and challenges, preferably relying on trusted third parties hosting data and training compute on behalf of authorized AI developers.Agreements with specific AI factories providing information on the data sets available and the conditions for using them for training AI models.Interoperability and governance framework of manufacturing data spaces including from national industrial data spaces to ensure that mechanisms to aggregate data for training AI could be taken",digital_europe

An EDIH can select to focus on specific group(s) of clients (e.g. mainly SMEs or mainly public sector).The performance of the hub will be evaluated based on their key performance indicators (KPIs); proposals should define their indicators as well as the targets related to each of them:Number of entities which have used the European Digital Innovation Hubs’ services, by user category (businesses of different sizes, public sector entities, etc.), sector, location, by technology and type of service received. Specific sub-indicators must be proposed when the services are related to develop and uptake AI solutions, and will include a description of which European AI Innovation Infrastructures have been used (such as the AI-on-Demand platform) or referred to (such as the AI Factories).Number of entity referral to European AI Innovation InfrastructuresFor access to finance: amount of additional investments successfully triggered (e.g. through venture capital, bank loan, etc.). Number of collaborations foreseen with other EDIHs and stakeholders outside the region at EU level, and description of jointly shared infrastructures / joint investments with other EDIHs. A set of additional impact indicators will be collected and analysed with the support of the Digital Transformation Accelerator:Increase in digital maturity of organizations that have used the services of the EDIH network. Digital maturity will be defined based on a questionnaire assessing the categories of digital strategy and readiness, intelligence and automation, data and connectedness, sustainable and human-centric digitalisation. EDIHs will administer the questionnaire at the start of the engagement with a client, and later after having delivered services, and report without delay the results to the DTA repository. Increase in number of companies benefiting from the use of European AI technology. Cross-border trans-national hubs are possible with several countries jointly proposing and co-funding cross-border trans-national hubs, serving neighbouring regions in different countries, tackling shared challenges identified in the border regions and exploiting the untapped growth potential in border areas. In this case, only the share of the funding of each country involved in the cross-border trans-national will be considered for the total amount of funding for that country.Objective:The objective is to complete the existing network of European Digital Innovation Hubs (EDIHs) with entities from countries associated to the Digital Europe Programme that have not yet participated in any previous EDIH call. These entities will provide the complete set of services of an EDIH, including the necessary infrastructure, focusing primarily on a specific geographical area and covering the digital transformation needs of the local SMEs, mid-caps and/or public sector organisations with a reinforced AI focus for EDIH operations.The completion of the EDIHs network will be pivotal in supporting the widespread deployment and uptake of European AI technologies, solutions and tool, while also promoting the adoption of other crucial digital technologies, all in alignment with EU values and a human-centric approach.Furthermore, the network will harness the potential of green digital technologies, contributing to Europe’s collective climate and environmental goals. This approach will not only enhance the resilience of European industry but also strengthen its strategic autonomy. With an enhanced presence in countries associated with Digital Europe, the EDIH network will help bridge technology gaps, and support competitiveness and economic convergence.EDIHs will collaborate with EU AI Innovation infrastructures, serving as central hubs for companies and the public sector. They will ensure a flexible and seamless digital journey, referring stakeholders to relevant services provided by these AI innovation infrastructures when appropriate. However, this collaboration does NOT mean that EDIHs need to integrate a representative of each EU AI infrastructures in their own consortium. It means that EDIHs must map out these infrastructures, establish contacts with them and help their customers towards benefiting from available services within a structured client journey. These collaborations will not only accelerate the deployment of AI technologies but also ensure their effective and ethical application. EDIHs will play a pivotal role in bridging the gap between AI research and real-world applications, driving economic growth and improving public services across Europe.The EDIHs will act as a multiplier and widely promote and facilitate the use of all the digital capacities built up under the different specific objectives of the Digital Europe Programme, including the effective use",digital_europe

Objective:Broadly speaking, the objective of this action is to coordinate and support the pilot projects delivering Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) solutions fully integrated into the operational workflows and IT systems of participating public administrations.First, this action should prioritise to enhance the scalability and replication of successful GenAI pilot solutions. This includes the projects' capabilities to be duplicated by other public administrations and to adjust efficiently to a growing number of users, public administrations, or application areas.Second, it will identify common needs from public administrations for GenAI solutions “Made in Europe”, facilitating the pooling of demand at EU level for European start-ups.As a result of these efforts, the action will deepen collaboration among public administrations across Member States, laying the foundation of a sustainable GenAI community. Through the dissemination of knowledge, tools, and mutual learning experiences, this community will help accelerate adoption and reinforce trust in European GenAI solutions.Scope:The selected consortium will be responsible for enhancing the scalability and replication of successful European GenAI pilot solutions, through activities that foster knowledge sharing, community building, and capacity development. Such activities could consist, for example, in implementing software documentation best practices, facilitating peer-to-peer knowledge sharing and experience exchange, deploying targeted training and support programs, and establishing a community of practice. A helpdesk can be set up to support pilot projects and other interested public administrations on technical, organisational and legal – such as procurement – matters. Importantly, the CSA will seek to identify common needs with the overarching goal of pooling demand from public administrations for GenAI solutions “Made in Europe”. Towards that end, the CSA will define benchmarks and minimum requirements at the technical level. It will work closely with and contribute to the innovation procurement hubs initiative[1], in particular to public procurement of innovation (PPI) and pre-commercial public procurement work strands. Furthermore, the CSA will raise awareness among European start-ups for its demand-pooling exercise through outreach activities targeted to start-up communities in Europe, conducting where relevant matchmaking exercises between public administrations and European start-ups.The CSA will play an important role in ensuring the pilot projects have a European dimension. This will be done by supporting the pilot projects with scalability and replicability. They will complement their planned actions with additional measures to maximise the reach and impact. Moreover, the European dimension will also be ensured by reporting on the pilot project’s activities, aggregating their KPIs and relevant figures to provide an overview on the use of GenAI by public administrations in Europe.Show more Topic descriptionExpected Outcome:Contribution to the replication and scalability of piloted GenAI solutions across public administrations and Member States, demonstrated through the ability to adapt them to new users, administrative levels or service areas.

Objective:This action aims to enhance the European genomic data infrastructure by supporting the deployment of advanced tools for data curation and use and its alignment with the European Health Data Space (EHDS). Data quality and volume are key success factors for health data infrastructures supported under the Digital Europe Programme, such as the one developed by the Genomic Data Infrastructure (GDI) project implementing the 1+ Million Genomes (1+MG) initiative of the Member States. The availability of thoroughly curated genomic data and related clinical and phenotypic information is a prerequisite for accelerating the move to the next level of multi-modal data modelling and deployment as well as health sector innovation in Europe. 1+MG and the projects implementing the initiative have worked and agreed on common data standards and ontologies, data quality criteria and thresholds, data inclusion policies and the necessary standard operational procedures. On that basis, data holders will need to quality-check and curate the datasets that they will be making available to 1+MG and EHDS (HealthData@EU) to ensure their interoperability and high value for users. Wide accessibility of the data and user-friendliness of the tools and services facilitating the access to data are critical success factors of the 1+MG data infrastructure. While such functionalities for research purposes have been already largely covered in the deployment project GDI, application in other use scenarios, in particular healthcare and public health policy, requires additional tools, application programming interfaces (APIs) and interfaces to address the corresponding specific user needs and requirements. The citizen perspective must be also factored in to ensure, through appropriate IT tools, full compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) rules regarding citizens’ rights on personal data protection. This action relates to the potential creation of a European Digital Infrastructure Consortium for genomic data (Genome EDIC) and supports the activities related to operating the 1+MG data infrastructure established with the support of Digital Europe under Work Programme 2021-2022 (GDI project), including its alignment with the requirements, technical specifications, and processes established by the EHDS Regulation to ensure a smooth functioning within the HealthData@EU infrastructure.Scope:Data tools for the 1+MG data infrastructure should be based on common standards and as automated as possible, and should enable data quality check at source, benchmarking, annotation and enhancement on the data provider end and by the operator of the data infrastructure, as appropriate. This covers the whole process of data inclusion, integration and access provision, as well as compliance assessment, risk management and data security assurance on the side of data infrastructure. All steps and functionalities should be designed to support the needs and requirements of three main use scenarios, i.e. research (largely already covered by the GDI project), and clinical care and public health policymaking. They should follow and implement the standards and procedures agreed within the 1+ Million Genomes initiative (1+MG Framework) and be compliant with the EHDS Regulation. For example, data curation tools should facilitate the description of datasets using a metadata standard compatible with the one required for the EU Dataset Catalogue of the EHDS (Health DCAT-AP), including its data quality and utility label as defined in the project QUANTUM. Metadata should also cover information about legal conditions and enablers for sharing the respective dataset. Moreover, the action should leverage best practices and strategies for linking clinical and genomic data at individual level, within the framework of EHDS where appropriate, to maximise access to data while preserving the security and privacy of data subjects (e.g. sampling, anonymisation and pseudonymisation techniques, data gap filling). Data minimisation tools should support compliance with the",digital_europe

To that end, the participating authorities shall set procedural arrangements on cooperation and information sharing.Furthermore, regional cable hubs could also benefit from additional solutions for the surveillance and protection of submarine cables, and the detection of malicious activities. For instance, situational awareness performed through the collection and analysis of in-situ, sea-based sensor data as well as relevant satellite imagery or undersea drones capacities.The Hubs could make use of existing systems which were not developed necessarily for Cable Security, such as the Integrated Maritime Systems, the Common Information Sharing Environment (CISE), the EU Copernicus Space Programme, and the Maritime Surveillance System. (MARSUR).The Hubs should also integrate direct cooperation with private entities, especially cable operators to increase access – in a highly secured framework - to information on ongoing and future threats and voluntary incident reporting.The Hubs should progressively also integrate the defence dimension, as any defence capacities is likely to increase the situational awareness as well as the capacity to respond fast in case of incident against these strategic critical infrastructures. To that end, Member States can integrate in the operations of the Hubs their defence capacities (e.g. navy or surveillance system) and operational command while building on international partnerships.To support the above activities of a Regional Cable Hub, a grant will be available to cover, among others, the preparatory activities for setting up the Regional Cable Hub, its interaction and cooperation between its members and with other stakeholders, as well as the running/operating costs involved, enabling the effective operation of the Regional Cable Hub. The grant could also be used to cover the acquisition of the infrastructures, tools and services needed to build-up the Regional Cable Hub but also to equip it with the necessary capacities to enhance the security and resilience of undersea cables, such as detection capacities.These actions aim at creating or strengthening Regional Cable Hubs, which occupy a central role in ensuring the Security and resilience of strategic and critical infrastructures, providers of essential services such as global connectivity and power supply. As previously noted, Regional Cable Hubs will have a crucial operative role in ensuring the security of undersea cables in the Union and will handle sensitive information.Pursuant to Article 12 of Regulation (EU) 2021/694, participation to the calls funded under this topic will be therefore subject to the restrictions of Article 12(5), as specified in Appendix 3 of this Work Programme.Objective:As part of the EU Action Plan on Cable Security, it was announced that the Commission, together with voluntary Member States, will work on Cable Integrated Surveillance Mechanisms per sea basin (‘Regional Cable Hubs’) to enhance the detection capacity against threats to undersea cables as they are critical infrastructure.Taking into account the fact that these cables are covered by the scope of NIS2 Directive that follows an all-hazards approach, it is crucial to protect their physical environment from events such as malicious acts, including cuts as integral part of the cable cybersecurity measures.The objective is to support the progressive establishment of Regional Cable hubs, one per sea basins of the EU, whose role will be to concretely enhance threats detection and operational security around these strategic infrastructures.This action is therefore aimed at supporting the set-up of processes, tools and services for detection and analysis of emerging threats, to establish a near real time situational awareness to protect the undersea cables. It includes the capacity to aggregate data and security information from all available sources (including established systems such as the Integrated Maritime System, or CISE, or National Cyber Hubs) and analyse them in an",digital_europe

The work will build on the existing technical specifications and reference implementation, and the results of the first round of Large Scale Pilots and aim to maintain the success of the eDelivery, eSignature and eID Building Blocks which have been taken up by Public Administrations (notably flagship applications of the Commission like the Import Control System, Business Registers Interconnection System, e-Justice, EU Sign, and the Once Only Technical System (OOTS)), helping provide 100% of key public services online (another Digital Decade goal) and the Private Sector (notably providers of electronic signatures) - both as Standards and through re-use of the reference implementations. In addition, the action should contribute to other relevant policy initiatives at EU level. Supported digital service infrastructures to facilitate European cross-border digital transactions include: European Digital Identity and Trust Services Ecosystem Gateways: These trust infrastructures allow companies, citizens, and administrations to validate European qualified trust service providers as well as the participants of the EU Digital Identity Wallet Ecosystem and support the governance of the regulatory system. eID Component: Ensuring legal, organizational, semantic, and technical interoperability for secure digital operations that require cross-border identity recognition. EU Digital Identity Wallet: Services and infrastructure for storing and sharing identity data for natural or legal persons as well as other electronic attestation of attributes, with a focus on business applications, including the infrastructure for certification of wallets. eDelivery: A standards-based solution for safe and cryptographically secured data exchange over the internet, which ensures secure data and documents exchange (C2C, B2C, B2B). eSignature: standards-based approach for secure communication of intent in digital transactions, with the electronic signature library being reused by multiple European trust services. These infrastructures will be defined, developed, adjusted, and maintained in collaboration with Member States. Their purpose is to enhance digital solutions across various policy domains, promote “interoperability by design,” and ensure accessibility for individuals with disabilities and older persons. The action aims to: Facilitate effective implementation of the European Digital Identity Regulation. Provision by Member States of a harmonized EU Digital Identity Wallet by the end of 2026, delivering on their legal obligation under the European Digital Identity Regulation and on the Digital Decade Target. Rapid adoption of the EU Digital Identity Wallet by citizens, public institutions and businesses. Showcase the EU Digital Identity Wallet as a global benchmark and provide funding for countries associated to the Digital Europe Programme to implement Wallets based on the EU Digital Identity Wallet technical specifications. This funding will support international acceptance of the EU Digital Identity Wallet, particularly in areas such as travel. Scope:The call focuses on supporting the roll-out of EU Mobile Driving Licences by issuers and verifiers of mobile driving licences.Show more Topic descriptionExpected Outcome:DeliverablesThe call for proposals targets issuers and verifiers of driving licences to support the roll-out of EU mobile driving licences in Member States. Grants will be provided to support the swift implementation.Objective:In spring 2024, the Regulation establishing the European Digital Identity Framework has been adopted, introducing a step change in the cross-border application of Digital Identity ushered in by the introduction of the EU Digital Identity Wallet in all Member States by the end of 2026.

Targeted training courses on the basis of the ECSF to improve the capacity of cyber security roles. •Applications for automated notification of private and public actors about compromised or insecure systems Objective:Where a Member State decides to participate in the European Cybersecurity Alert System, it shall designate or, where applicable, establish a National Cyber Hub, a single entity acting under the authority of the Member State.National Cyber Hubs have the capacity to act as a reference point and gateway to other public and private organisations at national level for collecting and analysing information on cyber threats and incidents and to contribute to a Cross-Border Cyber Hub. They are capable of detecting, aggregating, and analysing data and information relevant to cyber threats and incidents, such as cyber threat intelligence, by using in particular state-of-the-art technologies, and with the aim of preventing incidents.For the following programming cycle, the emphasis is on continuation of activities initiated during past years.The objective is to create or strengthen National Cyber Hubs, with state-of-the-art tools for monitoring, understanding and proactively managing cyber events, in close collaboration with relevant entities such as CSIRTs, ISACs, etc. They will also, where possible, benefit from information and feeds from other Cyber Hubs in their countries and use the aggregated data and analysis to deliver early warnings to targeted critical infrastructures on a need-to-know basis. National Cyber Hubs could also consider the possibility of monitoring undersea infrastructure, such as submarine cables.Scope:The aim is to build capacity for new or existing National Cyber Hubs, e.g. equipment, tools, data feeds, as well as costs related to data analysis, interconnection with Cross-Border Cyber Hubs, etc. This can include for example automation, analysis and correlation tools and data feeds covering Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) at various levels, ranging from field data to Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) data to higher level CTI. Automation is a key aspect in the efficient handling and processing of information. Where available, already established standards should be used, such as the Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)1 , for security advisories or for collecting and processing cybersecurity-related messages (e.g. IntelMQ project2). Applications developed by Cyber Hubs/SOCs should be compatible with European standardisation projects like the EU vulnerability database (EUVD). National Cyber Hubs should also leverage state-of-the-art technology such as artificial intelligence and dynamic learning of the threat landscape and context. This also includes the use of shared cybersecurity information, to the extent possible based on existing taxonomies and/or ontologies, and hardware to ensure the secure exchange and storage of information. The operations should be built upon live network data and other training data required in the initial phases. Where relevant, consideration should be given to SMEs as the ultimate recipients of cybersecurity operational information.A key element is the translation of advanced AI, data analytics and other relevant cybersecurity tools from research results to operational tools, and further testing and validating them in real conditions in combination with access to supercomputing facilities (e.g. to boost the correlation and detection features of cross-border platforms). Such activities are identified and proposed for financing in section 2.3, dedicated to AI for Cybersecurity, and topic 2.3.1.Furthermore, National Cyber Hubs could also consider deploying solutions for the surveillance and protection of critical undersea infrastructure, such as submarine cables, and the detection of malicious activities around them, to improve the resilience and security of this infrastructure, which is critical for global communications. The response to such hybrid threats could also include situational awareness performed through the collection and analysis of in situ, sea based sensor data as well as relevant satellite imagery. For such activities, operational synergies with the EU Copernicus Space Programme and in particular with its Security Service are required.Another key role for National Cyber Hubs is to facilitate knowledge transfer and sharing, as well as support training initiatives for all needed cybersecurity roles the basis, for instance, of the European Cybersecurity Skills Framework (ECSF3).

Objective:The former Cross-border SOC platforms were financed during previous calls and such collaboration is envisaged for the Cross-Border Cyber Hubs. They should provide new additional capacity building upon and complementing existing SOCs/Cyber Hubs, Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs), ISACs and other relevant actors.This action is aimed mainly at new Cross-Border Cyber Hubs. Supporting activities for the SOCs that were already launched under the previous DIGITAL work programmes (2021-2022 and 2023-2024)1 could also be included when relevant to ensure collaboration with the Cross-Border Cyber Hubs.In addition to setting up processes, tools and services for prevention, detection and analysis of emerging cyberattacks, the scope also covers the acquisition and/or adoption of common (automation) tools, processes and shared data infrastructures for the management and sharing of contextualised and actionable cybersecurity operational information across the EU. Well-established open standards for CTI sharing (e.g. MISP Standard2) or automation of advisory information (e.g. CSAF3) and cybersecurity related messages (e.g. by IntelMQ) should be considered. Cross-Border Cyber Hubs could also foresee the possibility to monitor undersea infrastructure, such as submarine cables.1 ENSOC and ATHENA consortia are already financed. 2 MISP Standard: https://www.misp-standard.org/. 3 Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF): Machine-processable format enables automated database reconciliation - https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN/Themen/Unternehmen-und-Organisationen/Informationen-und Empfehlungen/Empfehlungen-nach-Angriffszielen/Industrielle-Steuerungs-und Automatisierungssysteme/CSAF/CSAF_node.html.Scope:The Cross-Border Cyber Hubs platforms will contribute to enhancing and consolidating collective situational awareness and capabilities in detection and CTI, supporting the development of better performing data analytics, detection, and response tools, through the pooling of large amounts of data, including new data generated internally by the consortia members.The platforms should act as a central point allowing for broader pooling of relevant data and CTI, enabling the dissemination of threat information on a large scale and among a large and diverse set of actors (e.g. CERTs/CSIRTs, ISACs, operators of critical infrastructures).According to the Cyber Solidarity Act, the Cross-Border Cyber Hubs and the CSIRTs Network shall cooperate closely, in particular for the purpose of sharing information. To that end, they shall agree procedural arrangements on cooperation and sharing of relevant information and on the types of information to be shared.Furthermore, Cross-Border Cyber Hubs could also deploy solutions for the surveillance and protection of critical undersea infrastructure, such as submarine cables, and the detection of malicious activities around them, to improve the resilience and security of this infrastructure, which is critical for global communications. The response to such hybrid threats could also include situational awareness performed through the collection and analysis of in-situ, sea based sensor data as well as relevant satellite imagery. For this activity, operational synergies with the EU Copernicus Space Programme and in particular with its Security Service are required.Where the Cross-Border Cyber Hubs obtain information relating to a potential or ongoing large-scale cybersecurity incident, they shall ensure, for the purpose of common situational awareness, that relevant information as well as early warnings are provided to the authorities in the Member States and to the Commission through the EU-CyCLONe and the CSIRTs network61, without undue delay. A call for expression of interest will be launched to select entities in Member States that provide the necessary facilities to host and operate Cross-Border Cyber Hubs for pooling data on cybersecurity threats between several Member States. Applicants to the call for expressions of interest should describe the aims and objectives of the Cross-Border Cyber Hub, describe its role and how such role relates to other cybersecurity actors, and its potential cooperation with other public or private cybersecurity stakeholders. Applicants should also provide the detailed planning of the activities and tasks of the Cross-Border Cyber Hub, the services it will offer, the way they will operate and be operationalised, as well as the main milestones and deliverables. They should also specify what equipment, tools and services need to be procured and integrated to build up the Cross-Border Cyber Hub, its services and its infrastructure.To support the above activities of a Cross-Border Cyber Hub, the following two workstreams of activities are foreseen:","digital_europe"
