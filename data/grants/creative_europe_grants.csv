It is expected the project will bring about the Network of sites formally constituted and able to take forward the results achieved, and the project activities implemented so far. By ensuring that most resources are allocated directly to site-level and community-wide actions, supported by multilingualism schemes and cross-border collaborations, the project will deliver strong European added value, equitable participation across Member States, and optimal cost-effectiveness of EU investment.Objective:The European Heritage Label (henceforth “EHL”) is one of the most valuable EU initiatives to strengthen European citizens’ sense of belonging to the EU. It is a symbolic action established by the European Union to recognise and celebrate Europe’s shared cultural heritage.Initiated as an intergovernmental initiative and geared up at European Union level in 2011 (Decision No. 1194/2011/EU), the EHL aims to strengthen the sense of belonging among European Union citizens by highlighting and promoting the heritage sites that have played a significant role in the history, culture, and integration of Europe. The EHL is an action focusing on cultural landmarks, that hold a particular significance to the identity of the European Union and intends to further promote their European dimension and foster a greater appreciation for the shared values and history of Europe. In this context, the action plays an essential role in unifying citizens from diverse national backgrounds and enhancing their sense of connection to the European project. Until 2025, a total of 67 sites and 275 locations across 22 EU Member States have been awarded the European Heritage Label, encompassing a diverse range of locations that embody the rich cultural tapestry of the continent. As the number of EHL sites continues to grow, it is essential to centralise the development and exchange of joint practices and activities among them, as well as to formalise and enhance the visibility of the Action both at the local and international levels. The creation of a network of EHL sites, coordinated by a centralised secretariat was a logical next step in the development of the action. This network began with the EHL@Network initiative (2019 - 2022) and evolved into the EHL Bureau (2023-2026) with activities revolving around upskilling, networking, visibility and financing. The EHL Bureau has been instrumental in fostering collaboration among labelled sites, organising upskilling and learning opportunities through regional seminars and workshops and facilitating networking activities during events like the EHL Awards Ceremonies and EHL Days. The EHL Bureau was equally essential in enhancing the overall visibility of the action, creating a cohesive identity for EHL sites and transforming them into an interconnected community of practices. Finally, the EHL Bureau was instrumental in facilitating numerous collaborative initiatives, financing annual cross-borders projects closely aligned on the sites’ needs and the promotion of shared European values.ObjectivesThe general objective of the call is to continue to support the European Heritage Label network of sites, fostering training, exchanges, collaboration and opportunities among the EHL Stakeholders. This call will support a single organisation or a consortium of organisations, with a special focus on cultural heritage and capacity building, which are active in the creative and cultural sectors or running capacity-building and promotional work. The selected project is meant to act as a secretariat for the EHL Network. It will be key to accompany the work of the EHL sites and stakeholders and in ensuring the sustainability of the European Heritage Label, as specified below. The Network, through its secretariat, will support the range of EHL sites and stakeholders and their synergies with bodies active in the field of heritage, cultural and creative sectors together with educational sectors. A strong emphasis will be placed on directing resources towards community-wide actions and site-level projects, in order to generate tangible benefits for citizens while ensuring an efficient and impactful use of funds.It will target the following stakeholders in the EHL initiative:EHL Sites67 Heritage sites representing 275+ locations have been awarded",""

Yet, they are facing multiple challenges. Partially as a result of the digital shift, with readers shifting to online sources and traditional news outlets losing advertising revenues, the economic sustainability of professional journalism has come under pressure. Many media at the local level as well as those putting their public interest mission before profits, have had to close down, weakening media pluralism and posing risks for the good functioning of democracy.Topic 1. “Journalism Partnerships - Collaborations” seeks to help the wider European news media sector become more sustainable and resilient, including small media. Support is foreseen for collaborative projects in and between any news media (sub)sector and/or genre that aim to enhance cooperation, help media adapt to new economic and consumption realities and instil systemic change across that (sub)sector.PrioritiesProjects must focus on ways to develop collaborative transformation, from a business, technological and/or production point of view.Projects can aim to develop, inter alia, better revenue and monetisation models, new approaches to audience development, community-building and marketing, development of common professional/technical standards, new types of newsrooms, syndication networks or other models to exchange content/data between news media across the EU, or provide assistance to small media organisations. They can aim to increase efficiency and the quality of reporting through innovative journalistic collaborations. Projects can test innovative production methods and formats, or contribute to high-quality media production standards in other collaborative ways. Projects can aim to increase exchanges of best practices among journalists and optimise workflows for those journalism genres requiring more time and resources.Proposals may address one or more of the priorities outlined above, if relevant and based on the needs analysis of the chosen (sub)sector. The proposal should provide this needs analysis and explain how the proposed activities will work towards addressing the identified challengesActivitiesActivities can include events, online trainings and workshops for media professionals, exchange programmes, mentoring schemes, mapping of best practices, sector-wide development of technical standards, development of guidelines and editorial standards, production of practical guidebooks, development and testing of platforms and technical solutions to exchange ideas and best practices, promotional activities, or other activities that aim to uphold the viability of the sector. Sharing of best practices between operators in media markets/countries/regions with different and diverse characteristics (in terms of languages, production volumes, sizes, digitalisation levels etc.) is encouraged, to promote mutual learning. Applicants are encouraged to consider activities supporting media sectors lacking the means of adapting to the digital environment.Financial support to third parties will be accepted in projects which foresee exchange programmes for journalists and other media professionals, support to attend trainings or events, support to journalists and media outlets for collaborative journalistic projects, support for legal advice, support for the acquisition, development or maintenance of technical tools for collaborative journalism, support for events in these fields and/or prizes for collaboration or innovation.

Yet, they are facing multiple challenges. Partially as a result of the digital shift, with readers shifting to online sources and traditional news outlets losing advertising revenues, the economic sustainability of professional journalism has come under pressure. Many media at the local level as well as those putting their public interest mission before profits, have had to close down, weakening media pluralism and posing risks for the good functioning of democracy.Topic 2. “Journalism Partnerships - Pluralism” covers media sectors that are particularly relevant for democracy. Certain sectors having an important role for democratic debate lack the means to adapt to the digital environment, and phenomena such as shrinking newsrooms or media deserts can lead to a deterioration of pluralism. Support is thus needed for them to improve their position, adapt their methods, continue providing a first-hand source of original reporting to citizens, help keep decision-makers accountable and ultimately contribute to a more diverse and independent sector.Priorities Proposals must put in place funding schemes for news media entities and independent journalism and dedicate at least 60% of the total amount of the grant to it. Accompanying activities may be proposed. Applicant organisations should be in a position to set up funding schemes (support to third parties) targeting news media outlets, organisations and, if needed, professionals, such as local and regional media, community media, investigative journalism and organisations delivering public interest news, and in ways that enhance pluralistic media landscapes across the European Union. Non-profit and civil society organisations are particularly encouraged to apply.The proposed activities must focus on news media sectors of special relevance to democracy and civic participation, i.e. the role they play in enhancing democracy, shaping the public debate and bringing benefits to their audiences and communities, instead of focusing just on profit. For the purpose of this call, these sectors are in particular:Local and regional mediaIndependent and investigative journalismOrganisations delivering public interest news/public service journalism (such as community, legal and civic journalism and media, news increasing transparency about the media) Activities Applicants must present, develop and implement a funding scheme for cascading grants (i.e. regranting / support to third parties) for independent media and organisations primarily active in one or more of these sectors. They will cover as many geographical areas and news media organisations as possible.They shall focus on activities that contribute to sustaining, improving or transforming the work of the targeted parties. Activities can among others consist of:Innovations in editorial production (e.g. formats, content), coverage and revenue modelsThe improvement of distribution and dissemination of newsThe development and engagement of audiences and community-building strategiesThe development of technical tools applying to the above topicsTraining on the above topics Putting in place a funding scheme is compulsory. The funding should be accompanied by active communication towards a maximum of potential stakeholders across the geographical areas covered by the proposal. It is possible to complement the funding scheme with accompanying activities, if relevant and based on a needs analysis of the chosen subsector/s. Such accompanying activities may include, e.g., the development of deontological and governance standards, budgetary readiness, development of criteria and indicators framing their support, repositories of knowledge, legal advice or trainings. The proposal must explain how the proposed activities will work towards addressing the identified challenges.Proposals should focus on the European Union, and specifically areas with low provision of the specific news described above or in media markets where media pluralism is strained. The needs of smaller newsrooms may also be addressed.Activities must include concrete deliverables and set clear, objectively verifiable and quantifiable performance indicators for the mid-term and the end of the project. The estimated impact must be more precise than the sum of available distribution channels, and should be substantiated by a detailed outreach plan as well as proof of interest from the target groups.All projects need to respect widely accepted professional media standards. The chosen standards and the relevant mechanism to ensure them should be indicated in the proposal and confirmed with a signed Declaration on Standards & Independence (Annexed to the Application form). In cases of support given to editorial work, third parties need to operate with full editorial independence.All Partnerships should consider the ecological footprint of the activities they propose, and where relevant, describe the strategies to ensure a more sustainable and environmentally-respectful media sectors.Show more Topic",""
