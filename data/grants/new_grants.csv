"Economics of climate change and cost of inaction","https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/HORIZON-CL5-2026-07-D1-03?isExactMatch=true&status=31094502&frameworkProgramme=43108390&order=DESC&pageNumber=1&pageSize=50&sortBy=startDate","18 December 2025","horizon_europe","topic-details","Horizon Europe (HORIZON)","18 December 2025","15 April 2026","single-stage","Open","15000000","EUR","2026","HORIZON-RIA HORIZON Research and Innovation Actions","Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to some of the following expected outcomes: A more robust understanding of the costs of climate inaction and their distribution, accounting for climate change impacts, foregone co-benefits such as health and biodiversity related, and increased adaptation needs, stimulating higher levels of climate ambition. Greater consistency in how socio-economic and physical science disciplines address climate change with enhanced inter- and transdisciplinary collaboration leading to improved, more realistic and more context-specific, regionally differentiated assessments of socio-economic impacts of climate change, and tailored tools to better inform strategic decisions on climate action, security and resilience by public and private actors. Knowledge on the interactions between climate change impacts, climate action and global and regional economic performance is advanced. More clarity is gained on the implications of climate change and climate policies on European competitiveness, economic security and strategic autonomy, with enhanced assessment of opportunities, risks, benefits and costs for the EU economy and citizens. Best available evidence and policy recommendations are made available in a timely manner and effectively transferred to inform the Paris Agreement, European Climate Risk Assessments (EUCRA), the European Climate Adaptation Plan, the Preparedness Union Strategy, the Clean Industrial Deal, IPCC, IPBES and other initiative. Scope: As emphasized by the IPCC, it is urgent to better understand the benefits and opportunities associated with deep, rapid and sustained mitigation and accelerated adaptation action to inform strategic decisions. Comprehensive assessments of the socio-economic impacts of climate change are essential for this, however, current approaches face significant challenges with a wide uncertainty in global damage estimates, fragmentation, lack of comparability across methodologies, and reliance on extrapolation from historical data, increasingly unrealistic in the context of current unprecedented changes in the climate system. Actions should develop and enhance models, methods, and tools to improve the understanding of future socio-economic costs of climate inaction (for the purpose of this topic defined as insufficient, or delayed action), advancing novel approaches and frameworks to address the limitations in existing methodologies, integrating latest scientific evidence, diverse data sources and applicable to various conditions and contexts. In this context, actions are encouraged to leverage emerging digital capabilities, including, if appropriate, those developed under initiatives like Destination Earth. Research should account for the full spectrum of climate impacts, such as those from extreme and low-probability high-impact events and the consequences of trespassing Earth system tipping points, to ensure more comprehensive and accurate assessments. Cascading and compound effects as well as non-market impacts (e.g. health, biodiversity and ecosystems, migration) should be considered. Actions should also contribute to rethinking discount rates and damage functions to better reflect the long-term uncertainty of climate impacts and their implications. Actions should assess foregone co-benefits and missed opportunities of climate inaction, and their distribution, ranging from health-related gains to economic benefits like business and industrial opportunities, job creation, energy and economic security, innovation and lower costs, as well as environmental and social improvements such as from biodiversity conservation, and reduced inequalities. They should assess increased adaptation needs and costs associated with inadequate mitigation, accelerated climate impacts, lost resilience, crossing of adaptation limits as well as the impact on public budgets[1]. To provide the full picture, the cost of climate inaction should be compared with the cost of ambitious mitigation and adaptation. Actions should emphasise treatment of uncertainty, ethics, inequality and justice in the economic analysis of climate change. They should explore approaches more compatible with planetary boundaries, going beyond traditional welfare and cost-effectiveness models. This topic requires interdisciplinary collaboration between physical scientists, economists and other relevant SSH disciplines. Actions should include a process of co-design with stakeholders (e.g., representatives of governments, public administrations, such as civil protection competent authorities, or the private sector) to support uptake of the results. Proposals are expected to address only one of the following priority areas, which should be clearly indicated: Area A: Global Analysis should be global in scale, while also providing regionally resolved insights to enable comparisons across world regions, distinguishing between developing and developed, and duly reflecting diverse circumstances and contexts. International cooperation is generally encouraged and specifically required with low and lower/upper-middle-income countries[2] – particularly major GHG emitters[3] such as China (contributing to the EU-China Climate Change and Biodiversity (CCB) flagship initiative[4]), India, Brazil and Indonesia. It should enable delivery of robust, representative and widely accepted estimates, and support scientific capacity building where appropriate. Area B: The EU Actions should focus on the EU. Particular attention should be given to consequences for EU industrial performance, security of supply and strategic autonomy. All projects funded under this topic are strongly encouraged to collaborate and envisage clustering activities together and with other relevant projects in and outside of Horizon Europe.

In line with the Strategic Plan, the overall expected impact of this Destination is to contribute to the “Advancing science for a transition to a climate-neutral and resilient society”. Expected impacts: Research should contribute to closing major knowledge gaps on the changing climate together with their associated impacts and risks, on both society and nature. It should also help develop tools to support decision-makers in designing and implementing effective mitigation and adaptation actions at various time and spatial scales while properly accounting for synergies and trade-offs with other policy objectives, such as just transition, territorial cohesion and leaving no one behind. The main impacts to be generated by topics under this Destination are: Supporting climate action (both mitigation and adaptation) in Europe and globally, through advancing climate science and the knowledge base underpinning actionable solutions, to accelerate the transition to a climate-neutral, climate-resilient and prosperous society. Closing key knowledge gaps related to climate change, thereby contributing substantially to key European and international assessments such as IPCC, IPBES, EUCRA, and other initiatives such as the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) and the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) under the World Climate Research Programme. Strengthening the European Research Area on climate change by boosting scientific excellence and capacity in an inclusive manner across the participating countries. Maximising synergies between mitigation and adaptation and with other policy priorities such as biodiversity and ecosystem preservation and restoration, disaster-preparedness, digitalisation, circular economy, prosperity and competitiveness, strategic autonomy, security and resilience, just transition, and the Sustainable Development Goals by exploring co-benefits, trade-offs and potential unintended consequences of climate strategies and policy interventions. Important components of climate science research are also addressed in other Clusters -particularly Cluster 6 – which addresses the climate-ocean-cryosphere-polar nexus and the climate-energy-land-food-water-biodiversity nexus. Efforts to foster synergies and complementarities across these research activities are strongly encouraged. Show more Topic conditions and documents General conditions 1.

Scope: The global community’s ability to mitigate and adapt to climate change requires the continuous advancement of climate science and related disciplines. International climate policy is informed primarily by the assessments made by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which provides the most comprehensive and authoritative evaluation of the state of knowledge on climate science, including the Earth’s climate system and its expected changes under different scenarios. Despite the exponential increase of available data, other evidence and knowledge accumulated on these issues, there remain significant gaps in our understanding of key issues and processes. These may include factors such as insufficient or divergent evidence, low confidence findings or high uncertainties. Some of these gaps are identified in AR6 (specifically, in Working Group I contribution), “The Next Frontier for Climate Change Science”[1] and other relevant sources. Moreover, science has progressed since the closing of the evidence base used for AR6, raising new questions and avenues for inquiry. Proposals under this topic should seek to narrow the knowledge gaps in the realm of Earth system science (understood here as the scope of Working Group I of the IPCC), offering flexibility for applicants to define the specific research areas targeted. Proposals are expected to focus on issues clearly within the scope of Cluster 5, Destination 1, and not prominently addressed by other topics of the 2025 and 2026-2027 Work Programmes, encouraging new scientific insights and approaches, and the involvement of researchers and entities new to Horizon Europe. Successful proposals are expected to enhance the scientific foundations and inform scientific assessments in a way that ensures they are comprehensive, accurate, and relevant for decision-makers. Proposals should clearly identify the knowledge gap(s) they seek to address, substantiate why recent and ongoing research efforts are unlikely to sufficiently address the issue, explain how the proposed action is expected to contribute to the advancement of Earth system science and identify policy relevance of the research proposed. International cooperation in the context of IPCC, WCRP[2] and GCOS[3] is strongly encouraged where relevant. Proposals indicating use of satellite remote sensing data and derived products are encouraged to collaborate with projects selected under ESA’s FutureEO programme and the EC-ESA Earth System Science Initiative (ESSI) to facilitate access to and uptake of satellite data products and related tools or methodologies. They should dedicate resources for collaborative actions.

Scope: Climate change science is well-established and increasingly relevant to daily life and societal welfare. However, effectively communicating both the science and the necessary climate actions remains a significant challenge. Particularly challenging is understanding and addressing the spread of misinformation, disinformation, and misinterpretation. There is also a crucial need for a strengthened public trust in science and in democracy, and for evidence-based climate communication strategies that foster a sense of agency through empowering and positive narratives. Complex messages should be made accessible, relevant, and reliable to non-specialist audiences. Actions are expected to advance the understanding of the sources, channels, types, and influence of misinformation and disinformation on the public perception and assimilation of climate change-related information. The role of AI should also be investigated. Actions should identify, develop, and test strategies for the public and private sectors to detect, monitor and counteract mis/disinformation about climate and climate policy. Such tools and products should be made available for policymakers, companies and the general public to incentivise and equip society to critically assess climate change-related information online and offline. Research is expected to explore how to bridge the gap from climate knowledge and awareness to behavioural change, taking into consideration various factors that shape perceptions across different segments of the society. Actions should generate knowledge and develop innovative, engaging, tailored and multilingual tools, learning techniques, and narratives for impactful climate change communication frameworks at scale. Best-practice examples on European and international level should be retrieved. Climate scientists should be trained to effectively communicate with non-specialist audiences, including policymakers and other stakeholders. Research should investigate how to design and implement targeted communication campaigns that boost climate awareness and preparedness while preventing climate anxiety and counteract disinformation. These campaigns should promote fact-checking, clear and transparent knowledge on climate science and climate policymaking and foster the ability to interpret uncertainties. Citizen engagement, of youth and other vulnerable audiences in particular, is encouraged. Actions should develop communication strategies, tools and products tailored to real-world context and societal needs, to counter disinformation and enhance climate communication, leveraging visual and digital tools including AI, as appropriate. They should demonstrate clear pathways for uptake and scaling such as piloting with end-users and integration into existing platforms or frameworks. The primary focus of actions should be on Europe, with local and national foci as appropriate, while other regions may be used for framing information. International cooperation is encouraged, especially with the United States[1] and low- to middle-income countries automatically eligible for Horizon Europe funding [2]. This research requires a multi-faceted, interdisciplinary approach drawing on insights from the natural sciences, social sciences and humanities (SSH) including behavioural sciences and gender, media studies, and communication theory.

In line with the Strategic Plan, the overall expected impact of this Destination is to contribute to the “Advancing science for a transition to a climate-neutral and resilient society”. Expected impacts: Research should contribute to closing major knowledge gaps on the changing climate together with their associated impacts and risks, on both society and nature. It should also help develop tools to support decision-makers in designing and implementing effective mitigation and adaptation actions at various time and spatial scales while properly accounting for synergies and trade-offs with other policy objectives, such as just transition, territorial cohesion and leaving no one behind. The main impacts to be generated by topics under this Destination are: Supporting climate action (both mitigation and adaptation) in Europe and globally, through advancing climate science and the knowledge base underpinning actionable solutions, to accelerate the transition to a climate-neutral, climate-resilient and prosperous society. Closing key knowledge gaps related to climate change, thereby contributing substantially to key European and international assessments such as IPCC, IPBES, EUCRA, and other initiatives such as the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) and the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) under the World Climate Research Programme. Strengthening the European Research Area on climate change by boosting scientific excellence and capacity in an inclusive manner across the participating countries. Maximising synergies between mitigation and adaptation and with other policy priorities such as biodiversity and ecosystem preservation and restoration, disaster-preparedness, digitalisation, circular economy, prosperity and competitiveness, strategic autonomy, security and resilience, just transition, and the Sustainable Development Goals by exploring co-benefits, trade-offs and potential unintended consequences of climate strategies and policy interventions. Important components of climate science research are also addressed in other Clusters -particularly Cluster 6 – which addresses the climate-ocean-cryosphere-polar nexus and the climate-energy-land-food-water-biodiversity nexus.

Knowledge gaps identified in the EU Climate Risk Assessments (EUCRA)[1] and latest IPCC assessments are narrowed, including system specific, region specific and cross-cutting gaps, so that the future EUCRAs benefit from a significant reduction of current risk assessment limitations and useful knowledge is available for various policymaking contexts. Scope: The development and implementation of climate adaptation strategies and plans of the EU and Member States rely on the most accurate and decision-useful assessments of climate risks that science can provide. For this purpose, the new knowledge feeding future EUCRAs will be essential. In the first EUCRA assessment, a number of gaps in terms of knowledge and action, and corresponding recommendations are highlighted to underpin more effective EU policy intervention to manage climate risks, stressing the importance of a systemic approach to climate risk assessments, adaptation and resilience and of the interaction with non-climate risk drivers, such as biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation among others. To support the future EUCRAs and advance adaptation and climate preparedness, actions should improve the understanding and quantification of climate risks, their underlying drivers, and reduce associated uncertainties for different systems and regions. New knowledge should be integrated to assess the risks of wildcards (high impact low probability or black swan events), crossing of tipping points and transboundary, compound and cascading risks in a way that can facilitate decision-making. Evidence from recent experiences of materialised climate risks and the performance of adaptation efforts, encompassing the whole range from failure to success and including the role of behavioural aspects, should be mapped and analysed to improve understanding of the key factors that determine effective environmental and social resilience, preparedness and adaptation capacity[2]. However, developing context-specific adaptation strategies is out of the scope of this topic. The main focus is tackling knowledge gaps identified in the EUCRA. Actions should extend and improve the evidence base by retrieving inputs from relevant end-users, including local and regional authorities, and civil society organisations. While general aspects should cover the whole EU, actions should also improve understanding of sub-European and national to local specific risks. Actions should enhance methodologies and tools for risk assessment, making the outputs available through user-oriented EU portals. For these purposes, proposals should: Address at least two systems or sectors (e.g. ecosystems, agri-food, health, infrastructures, energy, water, economy and finance) that interact and have transboundary effects. Include study cases at sub-European scale. While all the cases together should cover the 4 regions defined in EUCRA[3], some of the individual cases should also address the transnational dimension (i.e. include more than one country of the particular region). Actions should contribute to future editions of EUCRA. Specific resources should be devoted to this purpose. Actions should leverage recent advances on other climate risk assessments and related frameworks from reliable sources (e.g. the World Climate Research Programme, WCRP). Actions are encouraged to integrate multiple data sources and to leverage digital technologies, such as AI/ML techniques, tools, and models, including those developed under the European Commission’s Destination Earth initiative, if appropriate. Coordination and collaboration with relevant projects from Mission Adaptation, Cluster 5 Destination 1 on Climate Science and Responses is encouraged, especially for evidence retrieval, national to local scale assessment, methodological consistency, and cross-fertilisation through project scientific boards; with projects from Cluster 3 Destination Disaster-Resilient Society for Europe for knowledge exchange and better integration of end-user perspectives, and from relevant Destinations in other Clusters. Actions are encouraged to make use of the European research infrastructures including Integrated Research Infrastructure Services for Climate Change Risks[4], if appropriate.

Ensured applicability and replicability of sustainable and digital strategies at port level for middle and small-size maritime ports and inland ports across all the EU, balancing geography and size. Ensured increased adoption of sustainable waterborne transport practices in ports of all sizes. Sustainable and digital strategies will prepare middle and small-sized ports to enhance their competitiveness with a focus on cost-effective and scalable adaptation measures, increase their climate resilience and biodiversity friendliness, and improve safety for port workers and crews of ships at berth. Sustainable and digital strategies will reduce emissions of GHG, air and water pollutants and other biodiversity impacts from ports, applying innovative solutions for zero-emission and biodiversity friendly port operations and ships at berth. Strategies should be applicable to maritime and inland waterway middle-sized and small-sized ports and located throughout Europe. Contribute to the objectives of the EU Port Strategy. Development of sustainable and digital strategies that not only enhance the competitiveness of middle-sized and small-sized ports but also mitigate health risks for populations in port areas. Scope: Ports are important multimodal hubs in the supply chain, linking the sea with the hinterland, evolving into critical hubs and facilitators of sustainable energies, are clusters of industry and circular economy, as well as geo-political and geo-economic resilience. Europe needs ports that are competitive and sustainable on local, regional and global levels, and the Competitiveness Compass calls for a new strategy to highlight the role that European ports will play in the future EU economy. The Green Deal aims to achieve climate neutrality by 2050 and to reverse the degradation of ecosystems by 2030. The EU Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy[1] (SSMS) states that infrastructure must be adapted to climate change, less biodiversity harmful and made resilient to disasters. In line with the SSMS, it is also important that ports can provide increasing volumes of clean and decarbonised energy sources, notably renewable energy, and on a modernised grid. Proposals are expected to address all the following aspects: Identify innovative technologies, as well as results from EU-funded research, innovation and deployment projects and other technological, economic and social best practices. Consider mature technologies ready to be deployed in middle and small-sized ports across the EU contributing to the expected outcomes. Address challenges and opportunities for the implementation and/or for commercial deployment of these solutions in small and medium-sized maritime ports and inland waterway ports located throughout the EU. Developing strategies contributing to the expected outcomes for middle and small ports across the EU following a geographical balance, contributing to the objectives of the EU Ports Strategy. Design and demonstrate integrated smart energy systems and grids for port and waterborne transport operations, including energy production, storage and OPS operations, covering the needs for electrification and charging of port terminal equipment, and modes of transport connecting the port to the hinterland, such road transport, nearby industry and buildings) to make the solutions more energy- and cost-effective. Develop climate resilience strategies of middle and small size ports and their infrastructure, including adaptation measures to address sea-level rise, extreme weather events, and other climate-related risks, with a focus on cost-effective and scalable solutions (such as nature-based solutions), building on best practices developed in EU-funded research projects. Analyse how VTMIS and port community systems can be developed and exploited to their full potential, harmonizing functionalities whenever possible, paving the way to automatic shipping. Consider possible linkages to eMSW and eFTI. Apply digital standards and common semantics which enable the harmonisation of collection and analysis of GHG and pollutant emissions at small and medium sized TEN-T ports network. When developing digital solutions proposals should consider cybersecurity implications and develop solutions that assess and manage vulnerabilities in IT and OT systems, establish robust incident response plans, implement strong access control measures, network and supply chain security, in line with EU standards such as the NIS Directive and the Cybersecurity Act and with the goal of achieving resilience and redundancy. Explore long-term workforce requirements for zero-emission, climate-resilient, biodiversity friendly, safe and competitive port operations, ensuring continuous knowledge transfer between universities, vocational training providers and industry. Develop a R&I roadmap for solutions of EU and EEA ports to address the areas covered under the expected outcomes, taking into consideration 2035 as an intermediate milestone and 2050 as the final one. Explore, with competent authorities and stakeholders, how environmental aspects related to zero pollution and circular economy for ports as well as maritime and inland waterway vessels can be improved in an environmentally and economically sustainable way (through reception facilities, degassing facilities, OPS...), in line with the ambition expressed in i.a. NAIADES III, SUMPs, local or regional Air Quality Plans and Waste Management Plans. Collaborate with industry stakeholders and regulatory bodies to align project outcomes with EU policy objectives, particularly the Port Strategy. Explore cooperation between ports, as well as stronger horizontal networking, to increase the efficiency of undertakings and improve the integration of European ports. Evaluate the financial implications of proposed solutions and identify possible strategies and tools for financing/funding as well as business models that go beyond request of public support. Solutions at project level must be demonstrated in at least six medium and small-sized TEN-T ports ensuring a geographical balance, of which five are maritime ports and one inland. Not all solution must necessarily be demonstrated in all ports. Proposals are expected to explain the contribution of their objectives, results, IP management and exploitation strategy to the EU added value creation and strategic autonomy throughout the supply and value chain, including competitiveness of the EU waterborne industry, enhancement of the EU’s R&I capacity, technological know-how capabilities and human capital, and resilience of the EU industrial and manufacturing base.

Demonstrated efficient integration of HD-BEV in logistics fleets and operations along several European corridor segments, building further on the initial fleet developed in the large-scale demonstrations and across several types of transport operators. Reinforced ecosystem connecting involved parties as fleet operators, charge providers, road authorities at local, regional, national and European levels – also reinforcing the industrial HD-BEV value chain in the EU. Scope: The implementation of zero emission vehicles for long-distance heavy-duty freight transport is of key importance to meet the European targets reducing greenhouse gas and air pollutants emissions. To further accelerate HD-BEV integration in logistic fleets and operations it is essential to identify and address the remaining barriers and challenges of their deployment. These barriers can be related to e.g. limitations in vehicle technology, digital tools, knowledge and user awareness, stakeholder engagement, energy and power availability, charging infrastructure needs such as depot charging and Megawatt Charging System (MCS), permit processes and connection to the grid and services. The challenges for logistics companies’ (also smaller operators) implementing zero emission transport solutions need to be addressed. Proposed actions are expected to address all of the following aspects: Perform large-scale demonstrations of HD BEV equipped with MCS reaching up to a hundred market-ready vehicles and new generation vehicles in logistics fleets operations, involving several transport operators also engaging SMEs and microenterprises, focussing on long-haul operation (average ≥600km operations) during extended durations of over twelve months. The demonstrations must cover at least four European corridors’ segments in at least four Member States (MS) and/or Associated Countries (AC), and involved HD BEV should where possible be also equipped with MCS connector. Identify and address the barriers and challenges to accelerate the deployment of fleets of HD-BEV in long-distance logistics operations in Europe, considering also the impact of battery degradation and the weather conditions in all seasons. Develop and integrate in the demonstrations the use of digital tools with use of AI, access to data sets, operational and governance logistics models including charging opportunities and models to facilitate increasing numbers of HD-BEVs in logistics operations Ensure synergies with the existing publicly accessible charging infrastructure available or funded under the CEF and/or other national/regional funding schemes and assess charging methods and business models for long-haul operations such as depot, destination, truck-stops, overnight etc., using different charging power considering cost and time optimisation. Only depot charging (mono and/or multi-operator) infrastructure can be (partially) funded in demonstration projects, including related innovative business models associated such as smart, bidirectional V2X solutions and possible second life of batteries. Develop a competition-compliant ecosystem for sharing data for HD-BEV fleet management in so-called data labs including data pooling, which can include publication of open and FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable) data, and which could build on the common European mobility data space, also supporting the dissemination best practices, learnings and capacity building mechanisms as levers for HD-BEV acceleration. Using the shared data, new services and tools can be developed, including AI-based tools, agents and model frameworks for fleet management, both for on-board and remote monitoring. Define and test use cases for the use of HD-BEV fleets in long-distance logistics operations for cross-border flows, operational strategies to shift freight transport demand to zero-emission solutions, and collaborative business model(s). Establish synergies and leverage with previous and ongoing projects related to HD-BEV and charging systems and with related forums, platforms and programmes, such as with the European Clean Corridors Initiative, as part of the Automotive Action Plan.[1] Map and assess how policies and relevant legislation (including incentives) can support an affordable transition to HD-BEV. Identify and address, by providing recommendations, remaining legal and regulatory barriers encountered in the demonstrations.

Improve knowledge on the risks posed by the introduction of renewable low zero-carbon fuels. A review of existing regulations, standards, and guidelines, for all EU Member States, with recommendations for updates, harmonisation or new regulations as needed. Define operational improvements required to enhance safety in storage, handling and bunkering of renewable low and zero-carbon fuels. Development of a strategy for skills development for port personnel and stakeholders involved in the handling, storage, and bunkering of renewable low and zero-carbon fuels, ensuring safe and efficient operations. Scope: The rapid transition to low and zero-carbon solutions in maritime and inland waterborne transport requires port authorities and stakeholders to swiftly adapt to supply large quantities of renewable low and zero-carbon fuels and electricity. However, this shift poses new safety challenges, particularly in port areas where multiple bunkering operations, import/export terminals, and fuel handling and storage activities coexist. The close location of most ports to cities and inhabited areas raises issues of safety on two fronts: the space deficit due to the difficulty of enlarging the port areas in these locations, (leading to e.g. the storage of various fuels in close proximity), and the broader danger to these inhabited areas due to their proximity to the ports and by extension the storage of these fuels. To ensure a safe and efficient energy transition, it is crucial to assess and mitigate the risks associated with the introduction of renewable low and zero-carbon fuels in port areas. As not all ports will be able to store every type of clean fuel in the port or neighbouring area, safety of transport and distribution within the port area (including anchorage) should also be analysed. Existing EU legislation regarding specifically the safety of port workers is limited. The Directive on the safe loading and unloading of bulk carriers (2001/96/EC) sets out the EU requirements which increase safety procedures for bulk carriers loading and unloading their solid cargo in EU ports. Further instruments such as the Directive on port State control (2009/16/EC) and the Directive on the investigation of accidents in the maritime transport sector (2009/18/EC, recently amended), while related to safety in the maritime sector, do not apply to the safety of port workers specifically. Broader instruments such as the EU Occupational Safety and Health Framework Directive (89/391/EEC) and the Directive on the Minimum Safety and Health Requirements for the Use of Work Equipment by Workers at Work (2009/104/EC), while applicable to port workers due to their general character, miss the intricacies needed to address the specific risks of workers in this sector. This issue is further exacerbated by the fact that port workers are being exposed to new risks due to the rising use of renewable low and zero-carbon fuels in the maritime sector and the need for safe bunkering and storage of these fuels in port areas. Given the above it is important to have a clear picture of the current status regarding the storage and bunkering of fuels across EU ports, identify existing and applicable legislation, map gaps and potential risks and make appropriate recommendations for follow-up actions. Proposals are expected to address all the following aspects: Conduct a comprehensive review of the risks associated with the introduction of renewable low and zero-carbon fuels within (inland and sea) the port areas, including distribution, simultaneous bunkering operations, import/export terminals, handling and storage of fuels. Analyse gaps in existing regulations, standards, and guidelines relevant to the safe handling and storage of renewable low and zero-carbon fuels, in maritime and inland TEN-T ports. Identify safety risks not adequately addressed by current rules and risk assessments, including Hazard Identification (HAZID) and Quantitative Risk Assessments (QRA) taking into account - inter-alia - gas dispersion, fire/explosion impacts and their probabilities using F-N curves. Develop guidelines and recommendations to ensure safe operations (considering environmental and health aspects) per fuel type in port areas, considering varying port sizes, services (including technical-nautical vessels), locations, and geographies, especially for ports located in populated areas including establishing safety zones. International rules, standards and guidelines should be taken into consideration (especially from the IMO and the IHPA where relevant). Relevant environmental Plans required by EU or national legislation such as Air Quality Plans should be considered. Develop standard risk assessment criteria for groups of ports with similar characteristics, operational and weather conditions by researching and establishing standard criteria for risk assessments in port planning and development. This includes defining safety-by-design procedures for new port infrastructures and bunkering operations. Engage with relevant stakeholders, including port authorities, terminal operators, shipping companies, trade unions and regulatory bodies, to ensure the practicality and effectiveness of the developed guidelines and recommendations. Additionally, a strategy for skills development should be presented, associating social partners and civil society where relevant. This strategy should include the design and implementation of comprehensive training modules tailored to various roles within port operations, focusing on the specific safety protocols and procedures associated with renewable low and zero-carbon fuels. Propose certification and continuous professional development pathways to maintain high safety standards and adapt to evolving technologies and regulations. This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Zero Emission Waterborne Transport’ (ZEWT). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on results to the European Partnership ‘Zero Emission Waterborne Transport’ (ZEWT) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.","General information Programme Horizon Europe (HORIZON) Call MOBILITY (HORIZON-CL5-2026-05) Type of action HORIZON-CSA HORIZON Coordination and Support Actions Type of MGA HORIZON Lump Sum Grant [HORIZON-AG-LS] Open For Submission Deadline model single-stage Opening date 18 December 2025 Deadline date 14 April 2026 17:00:00 Brussels time Topic description Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all the following expected outcomes: A comprehensive risk assessment of the introduction of renewable low and zero-carbon waterborne fuels, in maritime and inland port areas.

Demonstration of improved shipyard manufacturing processes in small and medium-size shipyards, capable of building waterborne vessels in the EU/EEA. Reduced complexity to perform future retrofits of vessels and enabling the later inclusion of several emissions saving technologies and solutions. Higher capability and efficiency of European shipyards and equipment manufacturers to meet the increasing need to convert the shipping fleet towards zero-emission and biodiversity friendly maritime transport. Making the shipbuilding and retrofitting industry better prepared for building and replicating low-to-zero emission ships. Scope: European shipbuilding industry is facing increasing pressure from international players, and there is a need to improve its competitiveness through innovation and technological advancements. The MARI-4YARD project together with RESURGAM, FIBRE4YARDS, SMARTYards and PENELOPE developed several solutions on materials, processes, AI and skills. Additionally, the project SEUS in Horizon Europe is developing an integrated software platform with the ambition to save time in engineering, assembly and construction at European shipyards. However, there is still a need to increase the ambition and demonstrate these solutions in medium and small-size shipyards. At the same time, shipyards are often located in sensitive natural areas, such as coastal regions and estuaries. This provides an opportunity for shipyards to evaluate and reduce their impact on the surrounding biodiversity. The topic aims to improve efficiency and sustainability of European ship newbuilding and retrofitting processes, to improve the use of resources and circularity, to develop necessary skills and improve working conditions. This requires considering all relevant innovations such as robotics, automation, digitalization and AI in the context of shipbuilding to enhance EU/EEA -focused value chains. The purpose is to increase the competitiveness of the European shipbuilding sector with a view to further replicating and utilizing results, including in potential applications to the Innovation Fund. Proposals are expected to address all the following aspects: Deployment and integration of innovative technologies and systems in small and medium-size EU and EEA shipyards to enhance the competitiveness and sustainability of newbuild, repair and retrofit processes and process chains. Pilot applications should consider all aspects of the shipbuilding process (including technological, business-related and organizational aspects), equipment, and ship design, potentially including: a) automation and robotics in shipbuilding processes; b) advanced digitalization in design and production; c) innovations in retrofitting and predictive maintenance of shipbuilding assets; circular economy in all relevant processes (construction, repairs, retrofitting and dismantling). Pilot applications should also consider systems interoperability and integration with existing shipyard infrastructure, tools and equipment. Explore advanced ways of digital collaboration (co-simulation, sharing digital data) while considering cyber security, to improve synergies within value chains, including equipment manufacturers, shipyards, ship designers and shipowners. Testing and physical demonstration of the developed technologies in real life shipyard ecosystem and as much as possible in relation with full scale ship building, including benchmarking of existing practices and consideration of environmental impacts and potential safety improvements for workers. Demonstrations should take place in at least three EU/EEA shipyards. Develop biodiversity friendly strategies, integrating nature-based solutions on site, promoting circularity and sustainability of processes. Additionally, a strategy for skills development should be presented, associating social partners and civil society where relevant. Propose measures to solidify the current strengths of smaller and medium-sized shipyards across Europe, with a focus on increasing competitiveness and growth, reinforcing and growing European shipyards and improving environmental performance. For exploitation purposes, proposals should: a) develop business plans and rollout strategies, including measures to reduce knowledge and technology leakage outside of Europe; b) identify clear target groups (vessel types, segments and processes) and their current state, deficiencies and improvement needs, and make a clear exploitation strategy on how to roll out the results to end-users. Proposals are expected to explain the contribution of their objectives, results, IP management and exploitation strategy to the EU added value creation and strategic autonomy throughout the supply and value chain, including competitiveness of the EU waterborne industry, enhancement of the EU’s R&I capacity, technological know-how capabilities and human capital, and resilience of the EU industrial and manufacturing base.

Real life demonstration of the value of functional integration in terms of user value (ensuring travel time) and responsiveness to user and societal needs (e.g. reduced space needed for the vehicles, reduced consumption of resources, responsive to diverse user needs and abilities), charging infrastructure (vehicle-to-grid integration), cost (e.g. reducing development and integration effort, number, and specs for individual components), and energy demand (e.g. load shifting). Testing and validation of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) functionalities in real-world conditions to ensure efficient, interoperable and software-driven integration between SDVs, recharging infrastructure.

Scope: In the past years a variety of road vehicle technologies on component and sub-system level (e. g. mechanical, electro-mechanical, electro-chemical, etc.) have been developed and offer the potential to be combined and improve user benefits at the embedded system level. The potential to further leverage these developments with Software Defined Vehicle solutions (e.g. high-level functionality ranging from energy efficiency and performance improvements to personalizing the driving experience) over the lifetime of the vehicle needs to be explored. This would bring together developers working at the embedded system level with those working on high-level functions also to ensure that novel solutions will conform with homologation requirements. Solutions coming from this project must also be compatible with current automotive standards, esp. regarding external infrastructure. Compatibility e.g. with EVSE regarding ISO 15118-20 must be ensured.

Target applications are expected to be fit for mass-market M1 C-segment vehicle or below. Identify required software interfaces (Application Programming Interface and/or software services), i.e. especially which kind of information/data are required for an energy-efficient in the context of powertrain, chassis, automated driving and vehicle SW/interfaces needed for vehicle-to-grid functionalities, considering the vehicle and environment. Develop solutions that minimize energy use while meeting users’ expectations, such as battery management, predictive maintenance, or eco-efficient routing and driving systems, leveraging AI-driven workflows when beneficial. When using AI-based approaches, projects are expected to ensure that the use AI in electric vehicles does not increase the overall energy need.

While significant advancements in global weather and climate science have transformed resilience efforts elsewhere, their benefits in Africa remain to be harnessed, to unlock the continent’s ability to address climate challenges more effectively. Actions should address critical knowledge gaps for improving weather and climate modelling for Africa in the context of changing climate, with focus on the understanding and representation of weather and climate dynamics in Africa at regional, interregional or continental scale.

In line with the Strategic Plan, the overall expected impact of this Destination is to contribute to the “Advancing science for a transition to a climate-neutral and resilient society”. Expected impacts: Research should contribute to closing major knowledge gaps on the changing climate together with their associated impacts and risks, on both society and nature. It should also help develop tools to support decision-makers in designing and implementing effective mitigation and adaptation actions at various time and spatial scales while properly accounting for synergies and trade-offs with other policy objectives, such as just transition, territorial cohesion and leaving no one behind. The main impacts to be generated by topics under this Destination are: Supporting climate action (both mitigation and adaptation) in Europe and globally, through advancing climate science and the knowledge base underpinning actionable solutions, to accelerate the transition to a climate-neutral, climate-resilient and prosperous society. Closing key knowledge gaps related to climate change, thereby contributing substantially to key European and international assessments such as IPCC, IPBES, EUCRA, and other initiatives such as the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) and the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) under the World Climate Research Programme. Strengthening the European Research Area on climate change by boosting scientific excellence and capacity in an inclusive manner across the participating countries. Maximising synergies between mitigation and adaptation and with other policy priorities such as biodiversity and ecosystem preservation and restoration, disaster-preparedness, digitalisation, circular economy, prosperity and competitiveness, strategic autonomy, security and resilience, just transition, and the Sustainable Development Goals by exploring co-benefits, trade-offs and potential unintended consequences of climate strategies and policy interventions. Important components of climate science research are also addressed in other Clusters -particularly Cluster 6 – which addresses the climate-ocean-cryosphere-polar nexus and the climate-energy-land-food-water-biodiversity nexus. Efforts to foster synergies and complementarities across these research activities are strongly encouraged. Show more Topic conditions and documents General conditions 1.

Scope: Climate monitoring of Essential Climate Variables[1] at global and regional scales is crucial to assess the state of our climate, its variability and change, and to track progress towards the goals of the Paris Agreement and the corresponding EU climate objectives. Underlying elements, in particular climate data records, reanalyses and forcings, are fundamental to climate science and serve multiple applications across weather, climate, environmental and sectoral domains, generating societal benefits. In turn, methods to distil information from this wealth of data can help extract relevant knowledge and key messages for climate policymaking. Proposals are expected to address only one of the following priority areas, which should be clearly indicated: A. Next generation climate data records Actions should advance innovative methods to enhance, expand and update climate data records; exploit recently rescued and/or new data streams; develop innovative methods to improve the water-energy-carbon cycle physical and bio-geochemical consistency across data records; and improve their applicability for users. B. Next generation Earth system reanalyses Actions should undertake research to prepare for the next generation global and European high resolution climate reanalyses. Progress is expected in enhanced data assimilation methods, further coupling the Earth system components, expanding atmospheric composition reanalysis backward in time, piloting carbon-energy-water cycle reanalyses, exploring data-driven methods for reanalyses and applying such improvements in subsequent applications and international initiatives. C. Next generation climate forcing and emission data sets Actions are expected to conduct research to ensure more updated and sustained production, and quality assurance procedures of climate forcings and emissions data sets in support of international climate change assessments and climate simulations, including harmonization between forcing and emission data sets (historical and scenarios). Additionally, all actions should promote the development and use of new, rescued or proxy data streams, and innovative digital tools and methods, including AI-based, to transform climate data into actionable knowledge. These efforts should align with, build upon, and support global intercomparison and coordination frameworks such as CMIP, promoting standardisation, accessibility and utility of climate information across climate science and service user communities, with due consideration of FAIR principles. Noting the current divestment of the US in climate and environmental related monitoring networks, which may severely impact climate research and services worldwide, proposers are requested to dedicate resources to the assessment and mitigation of such impacts towards increased resilience of climate monitoring at European and global scale. Research areas of particular interest include new data mining capabilities to facilitate the identification of events and areas of interest, anomalous climate behaviours, unexpected trends, etc. within those data sets. Equally welcome are methods to automate regular and consistent climate reporting along agreed climate indicators, to distil useful climate information (i.e. climate intelligence), and to derive knowledge tailored to relevant users (e.g. for sectoral applications and assessment such as biodiversity monitoring and ecosystem management), from expert users to policy makers and the general public. International cooperation in the context of IPCC, WCRP[2], GCOS[3], and IAMC[4] is strongly encouraged, as well as close coordination and complementarity with Copernicus, Destination Earth, and other relevant stakeholders.

Noting the current divestment of the US in climate and environmental related monitoring networks, which may severely impact climate research and services worldwide, proposers are requested to dedicate resources to the assessment and mitigation of such impacts towards increased resilience of climate monitoring at European and global scale. Research areas of particular interest include new data mining capabilities to facilitate the identification of events and areas of interest, anomalous climate behaviours, unexpected trends, etc. within those data sets. Equally welcome are methods to automate regular and consistent climate reporting along agreed climate indicators, to distil useful climate information (i.e. climate intelligence), and to derive knowledge tailored to relevant users (e.g. for sectoral applications and assessment such as biodiversity monitoring and ecosystem management), from expert users to policy makers and the general public. International cooperation in the context of IPCC, WCRP[2], GCOS[3], and IAMC[4] is strongly encouraged, as well as close coordination and complementarity with Copernicus, Destination Earth, and other relevant stakeholders.

In line with the Strategic Plan, the overall expected impact of this Destination is to contribute to the “Advancing science for a transition to a climate-neutral and resilient society”. Expected impacts: Research should contribute to closing major knowledge gaps on the changing climate together with their associated impacts and risks, on both society and nature. It should also help develop tools to support decision-makers in designing and implementing effective mitigation and adaptation actions at various time and spatial scales while properly accounting for synergies and trade-offs with other policy objectives, such as just transition, territorial cohesion and leaving no one behind. The main impacts to be generated by topics under this Destination are: Supporting climate action (both mitigation and adaptation) in Europe and globally, through advancing climate science and the knowledge base underpinning actionable solutions, to accelerate the transition to a climate-neutral, climate-resilient and prosperous society. Closing key knowledge gaps related to climate change, thereby contributing substantially to key European and international assessments such as IPCC, IPBES, EUCRA, and other initiatives such as the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) and the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) under the World Climate Research Programme. Strengthening the European Research Area on climate change by boosting scientific excellence and capacity in an inclusive manner across the participating countries. Maximising synergies between mitigation and adaptation and with other policy priorities such as biodiversity and ecosystem preservation and restoration, disaster-preparedness, digitalisation, circular economy, prosperity and competitiveness, strategic autonomy, security and resilience, just transition, and the Sustainable Development Goals by exploring co-benefits, trade-offs and potential unintended consequences of climate strategies and policy interventions. Important components of climate science research are also addressed in other Clusters -particularly Cluster 6 – which addresses the climate-ocean-cryosphere-polar nexus and the climate-energy-land-food-water-biodiversity nexus. Efforts to foster synergies and complementarities across these research activities are strongly encouraged. Show more Topic conditions and documents General conditions 1.

Show more Further information Introduction REINFORCING supports organizations and institutions in Europe in transitioning to a new paradigm where responsibility and openness drive research and innovation (R&I) processes. Green and digital transitions have become of paramount importance to address the societal challenges that European societies currently face. The twin transition will bring enormous benefits but also undesired externalities and implications. In this regard, EU institutions and territories need to shift to more open and transparent R&I practices in which all actors share responsibility to develop services and products that are acceptable, sustainable, and bring social satisfaction. The Open and Responsible Research and Innovation (ORRI) approach promotes collaborative efforts, sharing research outputs as early as possible for engaging citizens in co-creation processes and opening R&I to the whole society. Implementing Open and Responsible Research and Innovation (ORRI) can seem a daunting task. Over the past decade, many resources and tools have been created, but an effort to systematize, curate, and create a single-entry point was still missing. REINFORCING is this much-needed European central hub for ORRI. The REINFORCING platform is the entry point to knowledge, training, ORRI skills matchmaking, and capacity building for organizations interested in starting or continuing their journey to creating an inclusive R&I ecosystem. Furthermore, the project brokers unique networking opportunities for organizations, institutions, and territories interested in becoming part of the European ecosystem that is transforming the R&I system by bringing it closer to society and societal needs. To support this change, REINFORCING has ring-fenced funding to invite institutions from around Europe to develop projects aiming at implementing new modes of doing R&I that drive more just transitions. All the Calls have supported and will support territories and organizations experimenting with ORRI for the first time (ORRI Incubator Open Calls) as well as those scaling up their ORRI activities (ORRI Booster Open Calls). Call requirements and details Eligible applicants should demonstrate proven experience with ORRI practices and a strong commitment to institutionalizing these approaches within their organization or territory. Exceptionally and only for this Call, although this is a Booster Call with all the standard features of a Booster Call (maximum grant of €20,000, a project duration of 8 months, no requirement for a mandatory small consortium of two applicants, no ORRI training or mentoring services provided by the REINFORCING consortium, and only a final report required), applications from ORRI newcomers are also welcome. However, please note that in the event of an ex aequo ranking, applicants with prior ORRI experience will be prioritized. The REINFORCING Seventh Open Call, as a Booster Call, has specific and mandatory requirements to comply with: Release an ORRI resource (or ORRI Tool) to be inserted into the REINFORCING online platform. The resource should be included in the proposal text as one of the results to be delivered and its development in the list of activities to be performed. Attend the online internal 7th REINFORCING Open Call Kick-off meeting and online monthly meetings with the 7th REINFORCING Open Call Coordinator and REINFORCING consortium representatives. Take part in the online 7th Open Call mid-term review meeting. Join the online internal 7th REINFORCING Open Call Final Event. Participate in the public 7th REINFORCING Open Call Webinar at the end of the project. Contribute to the online communication and update of the REINFORCING project channels (e.g., website, social media, etc.) with grantees' achievements and information. Engage in peer learning activities. While designing your proposal, please bear in mind that REINFORCING does not fund: Training or consulting activities for institutions, organizations, and territories that are not part of the consortium, since institutional changes are requested to be visible and measurable in the funded entities (grantees). Activities related to technological developments and/or proof of concepts, while REINFORCING could support co-creation and/or visioning workshops linked to those activities - if coherent with the scope and the requirements of the Call. Activities of any kind in which artificial intelligence-based systems or techniques are used or developed. Reflection on AI ethics and responsibility can instead be part of the funded actions - if coherent with the scope and the requirements of the Call. Projects just exploring Responsible Security, RRI, or ORRI theory. Applications proposing such activities as listed above will be rejected in the initial phases of the evaluation process, as they will be considered ineligible. For the 7th REINFORCING Open Call, no more than 6 projects lasting 8 months will be supported with grants of up to 20,000 euros each. Please note that different durations of the projects (less or more than 8 months) are not possible and will not be considered eligible. Furthermore, please consider that all the funded projects will start on 1st May 2026 and end on 31st December 2026. No change to these dates can be negotiated. Information on application procedures is available on the REINFORCING website, where the Guide for applicants, the Frequently Asked Questions, and the Checklist for Applicants can be downloaded: https://reinforcing.eu/open-calls/current-calls The Call Coordinator of the REINFORCING 7th Open Call is VTT Ltd. Task description Responsible Security Open Call Description Europe is facing a rapidly evolving security landscape shaped by geopolitical tensions, technological disruptions, and societal transformations. In this context, the role of R&I in safeguarding security, democratic values, ethical standards, and societal resilience is more critical than ever. This open call supports organizations and institutions across Europe in exploring and implementing new modes of conducting R&I that respond to security-related challenges with responsibility, openness, and societal alignment. The call promotes the ORRI framework as the guiding approach to addressing the transformative security challenges facing Europe. It invites applicants to develop projects that foster collaboration between researchers, policymakers, civil society, and citizens to co-create solutions to enhance European security through innovative projects that explore and address the evolving landscape of European security with a particular emphasis on the principles of ORRI. This call seeks to support ORRI practices and related social and organizational innovations that address, or are inspired by, the following questions: Securitization of science and technology: How are scientific practices and innovations being developed within national and European security emphasizing policies and practices? How can we, in practice, balance securitization with openness, collaboration, and ethical standards? Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI): How can RRI frameworks be practically applied or adapted to security-related research and innovation domains? What mechanisms could help ensure acceptability and societal engagement in security-driven innovation? Policy, governance and organizational models: What new governance and organizational approaches are needed to simultaneously support security, research, innovation, and ethics? Applicants should tackle one or more of these challenges, or propose other relevant topics related to ORRI and EU securitization, providing justification for their selection in the application process. All projects should aim to contribute to a more inclusive, transparent, and ethically grounded European security R&I ecosystem. Potential Activities Projects applying to this call may include, but are not limited to, the following activities: Designing and implementing co-creation processes with citizens, civil society, or vulnerable groups to explore the societal impacts of dual-use technology (e.g., surveillance, AI, biotechnology). Developing training and dialogue workshops for researchers and innovators working in security or domains to embed RRI principles in their work. Establishing participatory foresight or scenario workshops to anticipate ethical and societal risks of emerging security-related research and innovation as well as dual-use technology. Start creating institutionally stable mechanisms (e.g., ethical review boards, socially responsible licensing) to manage the development and deployment of security research and/or dual-use technology in research institutions. Piloting citizen engagement models (e.g., citizen juries, deliberative panels) to inform national or regional security research agendas and policies. Applying the Societal Readiness Thinking Tool to align innovation trajectories with societal values and mitigate unintended consequences of security-focused research. Interdisciplinary and cross-sectoral collaboration is strongly encouraged. Projects must be based in or have relevance to the European context."

Our IT service is actively working to resolve the issue shortly. We apologise for any temporary inconvenience caused. 18 December 2025 The submission session is now available for: HORIZON-CL4-2026-02-DIGITAL-EMERGING-53-two-stage, HORIZON-CL4-2026-02-MAT-PROD-21-two-stage, HORIZON-CL4-2026-02-DIGITAL-EMERGING-51-two-stage Show more Topic destination Achieving technological leadership for Europe’s open strategic autonomy in raw materials, chemicals and innovative materials (2026-27) This Destination brings together the research and innovation for a globally competitive European industry through the twin green and digital transition, and the availability, development, use, reuse and disposal of chemicals, advanced materials and critical raw materials. The Competitiveness Compass announces initiatives that should be served directly by industry-linked activities in Cluster 4, through new, focused R&I activities, but also through the activities supported up to now: Clean Industrial Deal adopted in February 2025; Critical Raw Materials Act; Advanced Materials Communication and future Advanced Materials Act planned for 2026; Future Circular Economy Act planned for 2026; Steel and Metals Action Plan adopted in March 2025; European Chemicals Industry Action Plan adopted in July 2025; Industrial action plan for the European automotive sector adopted in March 2025; and Strategy on research and technology infrastructures, with regard to technology infrastructures and the valorisation of knowledge. In order to better translate these policy priorities into actions, to integrate the latest inputs from the partnerships, and to achieve synergies, this Work Programme part adopts a more integrated approach. The headings used under the two industry-focused destinations in previous work programmes, reflecting different partnerships and industrial sectors, are replaced by new headings making strongly interconnected contributions to the corresponding expected impacts in the Strategic Plan 2025-27, on green and digital transition and on autonomy in raw and advanced materials. The new approach takes into account R&I investments under previous work programmes and intends to introduce more synergies with other pillars (notably the European Innovation Council under Pillar III) as well as with Cluster 5. Topics in this Work Programme increasingly combine the priorities of different partnerships to enable synergies, e.g. with the Investment fund, while continuing to address the particularities of each partnership. The development of new and cross-cutting technologies will help transform existing value chains and create new ones. In addition to this Work Programme part, Cluster 4 participates in a horizontal Clean Industrial Deal Call, aiming to increase the competitiveness and decarbonisation of industry. The initiative will allow Horizon Europe beneficiaries to feed the EU deployment pipeline with R&I solutions close to market uptake and deployment, whilst also supporting the development by 2035 of a new batch of industry-led demonstrators designed for higher market readiness. In addition to decarbonisation, manufacturing and energy-intensive industries need to embrace the circular economy as a key pillar in the design of their value chains. This will be fundamental to their resource efficiency (in terms of materials, energy and water). Particularly important in this context is the upcycling of secondary raw materials and waste; de- and re-manufacturing; and the development of sustainable and resource-efficient industrial processes This Work Programme continues to promote across the calls the application of Safe and Sustainable by Design approach incorporating early and parallel considerations of innovation design choices on impacts on health, environment, climate and other sustainability parameters as a way of achieving stated policy objectives and fostering quick market uptake. Where projects are asked to contribute to the development of safe and sustainable products, projects should take into account safety concerns for consumers as well as the organisational health and safety aspects for industrial workers. Finally, to support start-ups and scale-ups, this Work Programme includes support for technology infrastructures and valorisation of knowledge. Business cases and exploitation strategies for industrialisation: This section applies only to those topics in this Destination, for which proposals should demonstrate the expected outcomes by including a business case and exploitation strategy for industrialisation. A business case and a credible initial exploitation strategy are essential components in the ultimate success of an industry-based project, as well as its prospects to attract further investments for deployment. They will both be decisive factors under the impact criterion, and proposers are encouraged to use the extended page limit to present a carefully considered business case and exploitation strategy, backed by the management of the companies involved. The business case should demonstrate the expected impact of the proposal in terms of enhanced market opportunities for the participants and deployment in the EU, in the short to medium term. It should describe the targeted market(s); estimated market size in the EU and globally; user and customer needs; and demonstrate that the solutions will match the market and user needs in a cost-effective manner; and describe the expected market position and competitive advantage. The exploitation strategy should identify obstacles, requirements and necessary actions involved in reaching higher TRLs (Technology Readiness Levels), for example: securing the required investments, including through possible synergies with other programmes; accessing the required skills; matching value chains; enhancing product robustness; securing industrial integrators; and user acceptance. For TRLs 6 and 7, a credible strategy to achieve future full-scale deployment in the EU is expected, indicating the intentions of the industrial partners after the end of the project. Where relevant, in the context of skills, it is recommended to develop training material to endow workers with the right skillset in order to support the uptake and deployment of new innovative products, services, and processes developed in the different projects. This material should be tested and be scalable, and can potentially be up-scaled through the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+). This will help the European labour force to close the skill gaps in the relevant sectors and occupational groups and improve employment and social levels across the EU and associated countries. Where projects are asked to contribute to the development of safe and sustainable products, projects should take into account safety concerns for consumers and the organisational health and safety aspects for industrial workers.
