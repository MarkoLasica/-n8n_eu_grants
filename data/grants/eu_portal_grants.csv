The goal is to facilitate international cooperation in nuclear research between European Union (and EURATOM associate Members) research organizations, universities, companies and their partners through financing trans-national access to key nuclear research infrastructures. The call is open to project proposals within all disciplines and topics of research, development and innovation that are in line with the strategic research and innovation Agenda (SRIA) of the Sustainable Nuclear Energy Technology Platform (SNETP). The project proposals supported by other European associations and organizations acting within EURATOM framework will be also considered. The beneficiaries are the organizations offering access to experimental infrastructures to selected project proposals and the research teams that are allowed to use the infrastructures for the work described within the project proposal. The applicants shall agree on the term of references upon submission of their proposalsThe researchers applying for the access are expected to liaise with the organization that owns/operate the infrastructure (among those listed in the OFFERR user facility database) and agree on all the logistical and technical aspects of the proposed work. The proposals should be prepared jointly by the visiting team and the visited facility/facilities.Two types of applications are possible:· “fast-track project” to perform studies of limited scope which are to be completed in less than 6 months of access to the infrastructure. This type of project can be awarded a financial support up to 50 kEUR (consult the catalogue of fast-track activities),· “complex project” to perform studies with extended scope to be completed in less than a year and a half (18 months). This second type of project can be allocated a financial support up to 1 MEUR[2]. [1] This project is funded by the Horizon Europe programme under grant agreement n°101060008.[2] If the cost is above 300 kEUR, the application will not be able to be funded by Financial Support to Third Parties (FSTP) process and the infrastructure owner will need to join the OFFERR project consortium.

Scope:By closing the gap between supply and demand in a way that reinforces EU open strategic autonomy, PCPs can make a key contribution to enhancing the European Union’s economy and competitiveness[1]. In order to master the green and digital transition and make our cities climate-neutral and liveable places, European public procurers need to lead by example by procuring more solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This topic therefore focuses on forward looking procurement of R&D to bring to the market new solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that can increase Europe’s resilience and preparedness to tackle the climate challenge.On the road towards climate-neutral cities this topic addresses the lack and fragmentation of public demand for innovative solutions. Europe’s companies, in particular SMEs and Startups, are indispensable in delivering the required innovations. As past experience shows that pre-commercial procurement opens up the procurement market for startups and enables the public sector to address societal challenges more effectively, public procurers should make more strategic use of PCP.This topic supports public procurers, specifically local authorities, to collectively implement PCPs to drive innovation from the demand side and open up wider commercialisation opportunities for companies in Europe to take or maintain international leadership in new markets for net-zero technologies that can deliver solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The aim is to leverage PCP to encourage the development and to provide a first customer reference for the piloting, installation and validation of breakthrough innovations.PCP actions target consortia of procurers with similar needs that want to procure together the development of innovative solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in cities. This topic does not provide direct funding to developers, industry or research organisations to perform R&D. They will be able to respond to the call for tenders launched by consortia of procurers funded under this call. Specific guidance on PCP actions and minimum eligibility requirements can be found in General Annexes H of the Horizon Europe work programme.Continuous dialogue between demand and supply side is required for the success of PCPs, therefore the effective involvement of end users (e.g. cities teams that would need to adopt climate mitigation solutions, regional structures cooperating with cities on climate mitigation, citizens etc.) needs to be considered in the proposal. Furthermore, to stimulate dialogue with the supply side, public procurers are required to organise an open market consultation before launching the procurement and to promote the call for tenders widely across Europe to potentially interested suppliers.Proposals should demonstrate sustainability of the action beyond the life of the project. They should demonstrate how the project is anchored in a clear strategy to provide climate-neutral cities and enhance the economy in a sustainable way through stronger early adoption of innovative solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Activities covered should include cooperation"

Fusion researchers are constantly challenging the scientific state-of-the-art and improving the technology thereby creating the conditions for innovation, much of which can be exploited in other science and industrial sectors for the benefit of society. The fundamental basis of the Euratom Programme is the drive and support for innovation across the product development chain from research to market. In this context the researcher plays a critical role.The SOFT Innovation Prize[1] is being offered to highlight and reward excellence in innovation that can be found in fusion research as well as the quality of the researchers and industries involved. Following the success of 2022 and 2024 editions of the SOFT Innovation Prize, the European Commission is holding the contest again in association with the next Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT) in 2026.There are no specific categories for this prize. Contestants are free to submit an application concerning any physics or technology innovation that has been developed in magnetic confinement fusion research and that has market potential or has been taken up (or recognised) by industry to be further developed for the market.The specific rules of the contest will be published in 2025 by the European Commission[2], which will launch and manage the contest and award the prize based on the judgement of independent experts.The complete application for the 'SOFT Innovation Prize' should include:a technical description of the innovationa state-of-the-art assessment of the innovationan account, in general terms, of the market potential for the exploitation of the innovation For the Model Rules of Contest for Prizes please see the Funding and Tenders Portal.Essential award criteria: The prize will be awarded, after closure of the contest, to the applicant(s) who in the opinion of the jury best addresses the following cumulative criteria[3]: Originality and replicability: The extent to which the idea is innovative, original and a first-of-a-kind use of the technology in industry or in the domain of application. The description should be clear, logically presented and well-illustrated.Technical excellence: The extent to which the innovation is demonstrably state-of-the-art and based on excellent science and engineering.Economic impact and exploitation of the innovation: The extent to which the submission demonstrates understanding and awareness of the relevant innovation aspects, including market potential, needs and business opportunities. Eligibility criteria:1. The contest is open to researchers, research teams, or industrial participants eligible for funding under the Euratom Research and Training Programme 2021-2025, to researchers or research teams working for a national programme in an ITER partner country[4] or in any third country that has a bilateral fusion cooperation agreement with Euratom in force and to industrial participants participating in the ITER[4]. Example of proof: the Commission may request substantiating document such as contracts, etc.2. The researcher, research team or industrial participant must obtain permission from the owner of the Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) to submit an application and provide supporting documentation.Expected results:By awarding the ‘SOFT Innovation Prize’, the Commission will showcase innovations in fusion research sector giving visibility to the most dynamic, forward-looking and innovative researchers, research teams or industrial contestants. This visibility will provide greater potential for valorisation of the fusion research. Furthermore, the contest will stimulate the EU and international partners to develop a stronger innovation and entrepreneurial culture in fusion research.The Commission applies an equal opportunities policy. With a view to promoting gender balance in nuclear field, the Commission would particularly welcome applications from women.Prize amounts: 1st Prize: EUR 50 000, 2nd Prize: 30 000, 3rd Prize: EUR 20 000.[1] The Prize is named after the biennial Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT) during which therecipients of the prize are presented[2] On the Funding & Tenders Portal (https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/programmes/horizon) but also actively publicised elsewhere to maximise participation.[3] Further clarification of these criteria might be published in the Rules of Contest.[4] Except for Russia, see exceptions indicated in the General Annex B.[5] Except for Russia, see exceptions indicated in the General Annex B.Show more Topic descriptionSpecific Challenge:Fusion research encompasses innovation in the domains of physics and technology over a wide range of specialisations.

By integrating cutting-edge capabilities into production-grade software, these codes will enable scientific discovery, and drive cross-sector innovation. They will ensure long-term sustainability and scalability of Europe's HPC ecosystem.This initiative will result in collaborations between researchers, industry, and HPC experts, promoting best practices in software development, optimization, and interoperability. By aligning with scientific grand challenges (e.g. fusion energy, development of high-capacity/low-cost batteries, AI-driven genomics-based personalized treatments or AI-driven cybersecurity), Lighthouse Codes will contribute to breakthroughs in scientific, industrial, and societal applications, strengthening Europe's technological autonomy and innovation capacity in the exascale and AI era.Expected outcomes include:Successful integration of cutting-edge capabilities into production-grade software, driving innovation and enhancing Europe’s scientific excellence and industrial competitiveness.Enhanced scientific and engineering productivity: Consolidated and optimized Lighthouse Codes lower technical barriers, enabling faster and more accurate simulations and computations. This supports scientific discovery, advances engineering solutions, and drives cross-sector innovation.Well-documented, high-quality codebases with well-defined scope and functionality, passing rigorous validation and reproducibility standards.Stronger alignment with EU grand challenges, ensuring that Lighthouse Codes contribute to Europe’s strategic priorities in science and industry. Objective:Central objective is the strategic and focused development of globally competitive HPC codes with high impact. This includes:further developing existing Lighthouse Codes,but also consolidating, refactoring, redesigning or rewriting existing applications, which will result in a state-of-the-art Lighthouse Code during the implementation of the proposal, and making the Lighthouse Code accessible to the wider HPC user community. ""Lighthouse Code"" refers to an application, a software development kit (SDK), or a software library which is distributed as a single package and meets the following broad criteria:Established professional software development and management structures involving professional HPC software engineers, including policies to ensure quality, coherence and compliance of contributions with community standards and best practices.An established large or rapidly growing user community, demonstrated through appropriate KPIs (e.g., number of users/growth trend, downloads, HPC resource allocations).Processes for systematic documentation as part of the development process providing comprehensive documentation of functionality, ensuring usability for both users and developers, including APIs, user manuals, and developer guides.Commitment towards code stewardship by at least one eligible legal entity, ensuring ongoing maintenance, updates, and strategic development beyond the grant period.Competitive scalability in the respective domain, and availability across multiple supercomputing architectures, including heterogeneous and accelerated platforms.Potential for broad adoption and high-impact applications in scientific, industrial or societal domains.Ownership and licensing framework, allowing both open-source and proprietary codes to be included, provided that access and development rights are clearly defined and consortium members demonstrate the competence to control and further develop the code. The software developments will establish best practices among European contributors and lead to sustainable, globally competitive software that can significantly impacts the wider HPC ecosystem.Lighthouse Codes are expected to demonstrate potential collaboration with relevant Centres of Excellence (CoEs) and the EuroHPC Academy, where appropriate, to benefit from the European community building and training efforts in key HPC domains.Scope:This call builds upon and complements HORIZON-EUROHPC-JU-2023-COE-03-01 and HORIZON-EUROHPC-JU-2023-COE-01-01 and should associate where relevant with the following actions: HORIZON-JU-EUROHPC-2026-COE-LH-01-01 and HORIZON-JU-EUROHPC-2026-COE-LH-01-02.Proposals should specify and describe the Lighthouse Code in detail. In this regard, communities are invited to present proposals which consolidate efforts dedicated, e. g. to multiple domain science codes, into one common Lighthouse Code.Proposals clearly identify and describe the Lighthouse Code(s) to be developed or consolidated which must either already exist or, in exceptional and well-justified cases, be a state-of-the-art reimplementation of functionality of existing code. Each proposal may include only one Lighthouse Code. If an entirely new Lighthouse Code is proposed, it must be based on existing applications with high impact, for example in science and technology, and demonstrate a credible potential to meet the Lighthouse Code criteria within the project’s duration.Proposals should focus on the development, consolidation, or expansion of a Lighthouse Code with clearly demonstrated scientific, technical, or societal impact. A robust software development plan, including a well-defined scope, timeline, and sustainability strategy, should be central to"

It will document current restoration activities concerning forests, biodiversity, carbon, and soils, and explore various restoration options to guide decision-making processes towards climate-smart forest management. One of the aims of the FORWARDS project is to engage and empower citizens and stakeholders in the co-creation of solutions that will support the future of forests amidst climate change challenges.In line with this goal, this grant call seeks to foster the development of inclusive initiatives that encourage the participation of citizens and stakeholders in decision-making processes for Climate Smart Forestry (CSF) and forest restoration at the forest management or policy level. Specifically, it aims to strengthen participatory governance by supporting the creation of structures and processes that actively involve citizens and stakeholders in the development of forest management and restoration strategies—on forest holdings or at governance levels.This call will support activities that employ various levels of societal engagement ranging from local community initiatives to larger regional or national programmes in Europe. Supported projects and activities will either complement existing, or implement new, social engagement activities in the context of Climate-Smart Forestry (CSF) or forest restoration.

The project, Advanced Cloud and High-performance computing Education for a Valiant Europe (ACHIEVE) is designed to enhance the quality of EU higher education in the domain of IT infrastructures and in particular HPC which is used to solve several complex questions in computational and data-intensive sciences. It offers a comprehensive approach, covering aspects from cloud computing, network architecture, to the advanced skills on HPC systems and their applications in answering complex questions like the simulation and modelling of physical phenomena (such as climate change, energy production, drug design, global security, and materials design), the analysis of large data sets (such as those in genome sequencing, astronomical observation, and cybersecurity), and the intricate design of engineered products, such as airplanes.ACHIEVE aims to implement a double-degree master's program (ISCED Level 7, 120 ECTS) focusing on Cloud and Networking Infrastructure with two specializations that align with the strategic development of advanced, green, and efficient HPC systems. Additionally, it includes a minor in Innovation and Entrepreneurship. This program will be collaboratively designed and delivered by eight higher education institutions from six different countries, in partnership with major industry associations and companies specializing in cloud computing and HPC, along with an innovative SME for educational program delivery, a non-profit association, and EIT Digital, a leader in advanced digital skills education in Europe.The specialised master’s programme, also includes a minor in Innovation and Entrepreneurship, are designed and delivered by a consortium consisting of 8 higher education institutions from 7 different countries, 2 innovative SMEs, 2 large enterprises, 3 leading research centre in Information Systems and EIT Digital, a pan-European organisation with in-depth knowledge and experience in the digital skills domain.About the scholarshipsACHIEVE provides eligible students the financial support to take part to the education programmes and offers scholarship programmes to promote diversity in terms of gender, age, social and economic background.

Through research and innovation and capacity building we enable local authorities and municipalities, service and infrastructure providers, and citizens to translate global strategies into local action.We develop the skills and tools to make urban change happen and boost the urgently needed urban transformations towards a sustainable future with enhanced quality of life in cities.About the CallThe purpose of this Call is to support transnational research and/or innovation projects addressing urban challenges to help cities in their transition towards a more sustainable economy and functioning. The challenges are grouped into three themes called Transition Pathways: Positive Energy Districts (PED), the 15-Minute City (15mC) and Circular Urban Economies (CUE).The projects selected within this Call will be funded directly by national/regional Funding Agencies from the following countries:List can be found on the Call websiteEach proposal must involve, at least, three partners from three countries of this list and eligible for funding by their respective national/regional Funding Agency. Two of those three countries must be eligible for EC Co-Fund (EU member states or Horizon Associated Countries). The added value of transnational collaboration should be clearly stated.The Call is open to a wide range of scientific disciplines and welcomes interdisciplinary approaches. It intends to support a large range of activities, from research to innovation and implementation. It also asks to engage explicitly stakeholders (companies, public authorities, NGOs…) in the projects and to consider users’ needs in the identification of the project goals.Information and EventsPartnership websiteCall websiteMatchmakingDUT Call 2025 Info Day (online): 9 September 2025 10:00 – 13:00 CETCall topicsThe basis of the call topics description are the three Transition Pathways (TP): Positive Energy Districts (PED), 15-minute City (15mC), and Circular Urban Economies (CUE).For each TP, several topics are defined. The context, issues and opportunities that define each topic are first presented first, in terms that aim to inspire research and innovation ideas, along with examples of expected results and outcomes that may be addressed either through the research-oriented approach or through the innovation-oriented approach.Furthermore, since urban transition issues are intrinsically interconnected, it is possible to address several topics, either from the same or from different TPs, within the same proposal.All projects should choose as their main TP the TP that is the closest to the subject they would like to address and may indicate the other TP involved if needed. Though the proposal will be evaluated within its principal main TP, crosscutting characteristics will also be taken into account in the assessment.15-minute City Pathway (15mC)Next steps for multimodal urban mobility, building on the travel experienceReimagining parking – transforming urban parking policiesMobility policymaking in context of radical contestationCircular Urban Economies Pathway (CUE)Resilient green and social infrastructureSustainable tourism – circular benefits and challengesPublic procurement to foster urban greening and circularityPositive Energy Districts Pathway (PED)Driving a just transition: PED strategies in social and subsidised housingEnsuring positive socio-economic impact: PEDs in local economies and energy marketsPEDs in urban heating and cooling strategiesSubmissionA two-step application procedure will be used in this Joint Transnational Call.

Each partner must fulfil the conditions of the national/regional funding organisation, as detailed in the Call documentation.The Call is open to international consortia involving partners from entities such as:Universities,Public research institutes, organisations, and centres,Private entities conducting research in QT.The grant for one legal entity being a partner organisation in one or more project consortia in the Call cannot exceed 1,000,000.00 EUR. This maximum amount, however, may be higher if the objective of the action would be impossible or overly difficult to achieve (and duly substantiated).EvaluationThe evaluation relies on international Evaluation Panels of experts, one for the Call topic of Quantum Phenomena and Resources (QPR) and one for Applied Quantum Science (AQS).Proposals are evaluated based on the criteria of Excellence, Impact, and Quality and efficiency of the implementation. Each evaluation criterion is assigned a score (ranging from 0 to 5) along with a corresponding weight. The threshold for each of the three criteria used for the evaluation is 3. The overall threshold, applying to the sum of the 3 individual scores with their respective coefficients, is 12 points.SelectionBased on the two ranking lists (AQS, QPR) provided by the Evaluation Panels, a final list of projects selected for funding will be approved by the QuantERA Call Steering Committee (CSC). CSC is the highest decision-making body of the QuantERA Call 2025, composed of Research Funding Organisations participating in the Call.Whilst typically the highest-ranked proposals will be selected for funding, there may be cases where a proposal cannot be funded due to budget constraints. Specifically, this may occur if one or more funding agencies have exhausted their budgets with no possibility of an increase, the European Commission's contribution through the gap-filling mechanism cannot cover the shortfall, and reducing the funding for project(s) supported by the affected Research Funding Organisation(s) is either impossible or would significantly impact the original proposal, i.e. such reductions could alter the proposal’s scope to the extent that its original ranking would be called into question. In such exceptional circumstances when the project in question cannot be funded, and the relevant funding agencies approve such solution, the choice may pass to the next highest-ranked proposal which can be fully supported.If at a given rank in the list not all ex aequo proposals can be selected, the criteria listed below will be applied in the following order:Maximisation of overall funding output – prioritising projects to ensure the highest possible overall funding is distributed,Comparability of success rates between topics – ensuring that the rates for both AQS and QPR topics are comparable,Inclusivity of funding across organisations – ensuring, if possible, that each"

Scope:Many public buyers around Europe still lack experience on innovation procurement and need training and guidance. To tackle this challenge, several countries around Europe have set up national competence centers that cooperate with policy makers in their country to implement capacity building measures for innovation procurement. With support of Horizon 2020 funding, in the past, five new competence centers were set up and started collaborating with five existing competence centers across borders[1].Europe wide benchmarking identified that there are still significant gaps in national capacity building structures for innovation procurement[2]. This action therefore aims to support setting up a European wide network of national competence centers for innovation procurement[3], inspired by the experience and activities of the previous initiative, and extend it further to additional countries and reinforce its activities.Activities undertaken by the network are expected to include the creation of new national competence centers for innovation procurement[4] as well as the enlargement and deepening of the scope of activities of existing competence centers. The expected minimum participation is 10 existing national competence centers for innovation procurement plus 5 public bodies that have the mandate to setup 5 new national competence centers for innovation procurement in 5 different Member States or Associated Countries, with at least 2 of the 5 new ones in ‘emerging’ or ‘moderate’ innovator countries[5]. The network will thus start with participation from at least 15 different EU Member States or Associated Countries and it is expected to aim for participation of national competence centers for innovation procurement from all Member States in the network by the end of the project.Activities undertaken by the network should also include experience sharing on the implementation of pre-commercial procurement (PCP) and public procurement of innovative solutions (PPI) across Europe, promoting Horizon Europe funding and synergies with ESIF funding for PCP and PPI to public procurers in cooperation with NCPs as well as supporting public procurers in launching such procurements.Cooperation among public procurers is important because potential market size is a key decision factor for firms to participate or not in a public procurement and to help them grow their business across Europe. Scaling up the impacts of completed innovation procurements by diffusing the uptake of innovative solutions to other public buyers is also vital to mainstream innovation procurement. Activities undertaken by the network are therefore also expected to facilitate the creation of national and transnational buyer groups that ensure wider diffusion of innovations from innovation procurements as well as the creation of transnational buyer groups that start new joint innovation procurements on new topics. In this context, attention should be paid to reinforcing procurements that involve strategic technologies that are key for safeguarding Europe’s economic security. The network is also expected to promote national innovation procurement business opportunities to companies across other EU Member States and Associated Countries. It is encouraged to collaborate closely with the EIC business acceleration services and the Enterprise Europe Network to ensure a wide outreach among European startups and SMEs and raise their awareness on the business opportunities offered by innovation procurement across EU Member States and Associated Countries.Planned activities are also expected to include collaboration with national policy makers that are responsible for the policies that support the uptake of innovation procurement, in particular R&I and public procurement policies. The competence centers should cooperate with such policy makers to develop and"

Scope:The lack of later-stage funding and partners for expansion to foreign markets is one of the most problematic aspects of business growth particularly for the startups from less developed innovation ecosystems. In order to scale to a leading business, startups need to expand to foreign markets beyond their region. At earlier stages start-ups are typically supported by local investors and partners. However, in order to expand inside the EU they would need access to the funding from actors with presence and knowledge in these new markets. The lack of partners for expansion to foreign markets beyond their region is harmful for local start-ups’ growth and investor activity and the development of regional scale-ups, even more so for women-led companies. While the limited number of established European start-up hubs attract significant money and traction, the innovation ecosystems in other areas struggle to keep pace with fewer resources, including funds and technical expertise. In the struggle for resources, many start-ups face the choice to either forego growth and ultimately close their business or move elsewhere, while foreign investors struggle to enter new markets due to insufficient information about the market, its opportunities and regulatory frameworks.If organised and structured, investments ecosystems should be able to attract foreign investors into “emerging’ and ‘moderate’ innovation ecosystems by raising awareness of local innovation ecosystems and their start-ups, as well as the potential of the whole region, to capital providers from across Europe. Foreign investors should be interested to support startups from these ecosystems to expand to other markets and increase their connectivity to relevant partners and market knowledge.The action supports co-designed programmes of activities, of at least two (2) years, proposed by business acceleration service providers and/or investor networks and clubs, and/or innovation hubs[2] located in less developed innovation ecosystems (‘emerging’ and ‘moderate’) and more developed ones (‘strong innovators’ and innovation leaders’), to facilitate the entry of foreign funders from ‘strong innovators’ and innovation leaders’ regions to less developed innovation ecosystems through activities, including at least five of the examples below:market orientation/introduction programmes for foreign investors, including establishment of central points of information for foreign investors providing them with knowledge on the ecosystem's establishment conditions, incentives, tax and local legislation;market orientation/introduction programmes of developed markets for local startups and funds, including establishment of central point of information providing them with knowledge on the ecosystem's establishment conditions, incentives, tax and local legislation;assistance to foreign investors during the whole process of investment, from the pre-entry stage until the exit, by ensuring support in administrative, legal, linguistic and cultural issues;roadshow to leading innovation hubs to showcase the potential of the local ecosystem, its promising start-ups and active local investors;organisation of European international business forums, conferences and events to attract and connect foreign investors with local investors;establishing cooperation with public and private buyers of innovative solutions and with the innovative companies they are buying from; peer-matching of investors and business angles and other networking activities to encourage joint ventures;a repository of best practices of market entry facilitation for foreign investors;a repository of best practices of market entry facilitation for startups from 'emerging” or 'moderate' innovator regions to markets of foreign 'strong' or 'innovation leader' innovator regions;a list of recommendations for local authorities and European regulators to better address investors’ entry challenges and facilitate cross-border deals. All of these activities should be targeted to one or several of the 5 burning challenges of the New European Innovation Agenda in"

Pre-proposals and full proposals must be submitted electronically via a specifically designed web platform, the Electronic Proposal Submission System, using the templates provided and in line with the Guidelines for Proposal Submission.Applicants should note that the online system may experience high traffic volumes in the last hours before the submission deadline and it is therefore highly recommended to submit the final version of the pre / full-proposal well in advance of the deadline to avoid any last-minute technical problems. Requests for extensions of the deadline due to last minute technical problems will not be considered.Evaluation ProceduresA two-step evaluation procedure will apply, for the pre-proposals (step 1) and the full proposals (step 2) respectively. The evaluation procedure will be common for all proposals submitted under the JTC and Early Career Researcher (ECR) modality. The Call Secretariat (CS) will check that no Conflict of Interest exists concerning the proposals evaluated.All proposals, either submitted under the Regular or the ECR modality, will be evaluated by the same Evaluation Panel (EP) and in accordance with the same evaluation criteria defined in chapter 5 of the Call Announcement, and ranked in the same ranking list.An independent observer will be invited as external observer to the EP meetings to assess the conformity of the general procedure with the EU regulation.Step 1 (Pre-proposal stage)Pre-proposals submitted correctly and within the deadline will be checked for eligibility by the Call Secretariat against criteria defined in chapter 4 of the Call Announcement and by the Funding Partner Organisations (FPOs) according to their national/regional criteria.All eligible pre-proposals should be subject to a scientific evaluation by three EP members, as far as possible, based on two criteria - ‘Excellence’ and ‘Impact’. One of the evaluators will act as the rapporteur during the EP meeting.During the EP meeting, the evaluation results of each pre-proposal will be presented by the rapporteur. The EP will discuss the pre-proposals and agree on the final scores for each criterion. All applicants will receive a consensus report from the EP.A ranking list of pre-proposals will be produced, including only those pre-proposals that meet the minimum threshold, i.e., 3 out of 5 in each criterion. The final score will be agreed by the EP for each criterion, and afterwards, the two criteria will be summed up to produce the final score.The objective of this first step is to identify the best proposals to proceed to Step 2 and to ensure balance between requested and available funds at the national/regional level. The ranked eligible pre-proposals will be sent to the Call Steering Committee (CSC) and divided in 3 groups, according to their scores: Group A (highest evaluation scores), Group B (medium evaluation scores) and Group C (low evaluation scores). All pre-proposals in Group A, will be invited to Step 2. Among the pre-proposals in Group B, proposals will be selected to Step 2, taking into account the ranking list, the representativeness of all FPOs, the participation in the ECR modality and the funding ratio limits. Pre-proposals in Group C will be dismissed for their low classification.Consortium Coordinators will be informed of the outcomes by the CS and, if appropriate, invited to submit a full proposal.Step 2"

All pre-proposals in Group A will be invited to Step 2. Among the pre-proposals in Group B, proposals will be selected for step 2, considering the ranking list, the representativeness of all PFOs, and the funding ratio limits. Group C will be dismissed for their low ranking and unavailability of funding.Full proposal stage (Step 2)All eligible full proposals will be subject to a scientific evaluation by at least three independent reviewers of the IEC who will be assigned by matching expert’s profiles with the need for full proposals evaluation. One of the IEC members will be nominated as a rapporteur.The evaluation of each full proposal will be based on the following criteria:-Excellence (Threshold: 3/5)-Impact (Threshold: 3/5)-Quality and efficiency of implementation (Threshold: 3/5)During the IEC meeting, the evaluators will present the evaluation results of each proposal. The IEC will discuss full proposals and agree on the final scores for each criterion.The final ranking list will be forwarded to the CSC, which will meet to decide on the projects to be recommended for funding by PFOs.Show more Submission & evaluation process Submission procedures:A two-stage procedure will apply to this Joint Transnational Call; at stage 1 the submission of pre-proposals is mandatory, and at stage 2, applicants must submit full proposals upon invitation.

Significant volumes of advanced biofuels and renewable fuels of non-biological origin (RFNBOs) are needed to cover the current fleets and the sectors where renewable fuels are the main long-term solution, such as aviation and shipping and energy-intensive industries. Therefore, an exceptional effort is needed to establish more successful projects where full-scale plants are built and operated based on the vast potential of sustainable feedstocks throughout the EU.Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:Energy producers and consumers in transport and energy-intensive industries benefit from the mobilisation of building of industrial capacity for advanced biofuels and renewable fuels of non-biological origin;Technology developers benefit from the support to the preparation of first-of-a-kind plants of advanced biofuels and/or renewable fuels of non-biological origin to become precursors for the following commercial plants;Technology providers benefit from the de-risking of the innovative technologies, reduction of CAPEX and production costs, boosting of scale-up and contribution to market up-take of advanced biofuels and/or renewable fuels of non-biological origin;Public authorities, citizens, researchers, and industrial stakeholders benefit from the improvement of the sustainability, reliability, robustness, and security of the relevant value chain;National authorities profit from the provided evidence for innovative advanced biofuels and/or renewable fuels of non-biological origin technologies, which can contribute to the Renewable Energy Directive indicative target for innovative renewable energy technology in each Member State of at least 5 % of newly installed renewable energy capacity by 2030, as well as to the targets under ReFuelEU Aviation and FuelEU Maritime. Policy makers and regulators profit from the provided factual information and evidence in view of their decision as regards accelerating permitting procedures, harvesting benefits from multiple uses of land and water and increasing the responsiveness of research and innovation in that field to diverse societal interests and concerns; The implementation of the Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET Plan) Action for Renewable Fuels and Bioenergy is supported and facilitated. Scope:Demonstrate innovative large-scale production of liquid advanced biofuels and/or renewable fuels of non-biological origin for sectors with specific need for such fuels (particularly aviation and shipping and energy-intensive industries). Production is expected to be based on various EU sustainable biomass feedstocks, notably biogenic residues and wastes, biogenic part of slurries and industrial wastes, and/or on non-biological origin feedstocks, such as renewable hydrogen and CO2 or renewable carbon, nitrogen, or their compounds, through chemical, biochemical, biological, and thermochemical pathways, or a combination of them. Proposals are expected to:demonstrate large scale production of ready-to-deploy advanced biofuels and/or renewable fuels of non-biological origin, engaging feedstock developers and suppliers, technology developers, fuel suppliers, end users for purchasing the quantities, national bodies, and public or private authorities with funding capacity;address and assess the impact of actual, real-size feedstocks, (like for example agricultural wastes, energy crops grown on marginal and degraded lands or as intermediate crops, forestry wastes, biogenic municipal and industrial wastes, all types of renewable hydrogen, actual streams of CO2 and nitrogen, available renewable carbon or their compounds), in terms of their constitution on plant design, (e.g. for feedstock pretreatment and wastewater treatment as appropriate);address and assess the impact on plant design and feasibility of improving the feedstocks externally and upstream to the fuel production plant, by increasing the energy density of the feedstocks through for example torrefaction, by homogenisation of feedstocks for making them uniform or similar, and by standardisation of feedstocks, as appropriate. Projects should produce a lifetime cycle analysis of their production route and in particular for renewable fuels of non-biological origin, as inputs in terms of renewable energy and material (CO2, nitrogen, renewable hydrogen) may not be continuously available.Production of renewable hydrogen as an end-product is excluded from the scope of this topic.The projects are expected to result in reference cases for ready-to-build, revamp/reuse and/or operate full-scale plants of advanced biofuels and/or renewable fuels of non-biological origin. Improvements, optimisation, new schemes and modification of existing demonstration plants that can result into the preparation of the next full-scale plant are considered within scope to encourage deployment of cost-effective solutions.The plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results should include a strong investment"

At the same time, it calls for research on the cumulative impacts of offshore energy generation on the environment, which was also underlined in the Communication on Delivering on the EU offshore renewable energy ambitions (2023)[2].Our knowledge on such impacts, positive and negative, is more advanced now than when the Offshore Strategy was adopted[3]. However, there are still significant data and knowledge gaps. Most fieldwork studies have been carried out at very localised sites and often focused on specific species. These ad-hoc studies lead to conclusions that can hardly be generalised. A sound monitoring, measuring multiple pressures and impacts on ecosystems and their services, at wider scale and in interaction with other sea activities, is still largely missing. There is also a need to further develop models and other instruments for environmental risk assessment, identification of mitigation measures and recommendations for restoration measures, considering impacts during construction, operation and maintenance, repowering and decommissioning.Improving instruments, data, and knowledge on the cumulative environmental impacts of offshore energy, as well as a sound monitoring, is key to ensure that its expected fast and large-scale deployment will be sustainable. It will also better equip the EU to contribute to mitigate such impacts and promote sustainable deployment of offshore wind at regional (e.g., through OSPAR[4] in the Northeast Atlantic) or subregional (e.g., through the Greater North Sea basin Initiative) level.Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:The scientific community, public authorities, project designers, permitting authorities, civil society organisations and citizens have better tools (including Maritime Spatial Planning tools), reliable data and knowledge to monitor, assess and minimise the cumulative environmental, including on biodiversity, and socio-ecological impacts of large-scale bottom-fixed and floating offshore wind energy generation, including at sea-basin level and when combined with other planned or existing human activities;The monitoring of cumulative environmental impacts, including on biodiversity, of offshore wind installations is improved, with better tools and open data, in a coherent scheme with pre-existing monitoring programs of the marine environment at large scale;Ambitious national and regional offshore wind deployment targets are achieved with positive or minimum negative impacts on the marine and coastal environment;Deploy offshore wind energy with minimal impact on marine and coastal ecosystems, and, if possible, with net-positive ones. Scope:Proposals are expected to address at least five of the following aspects:Provide better knowledge and understanding of the cumulative environmental impacts of the offshore wind energy deployment according to the EU targets, when added to the current and planned human activities carried out in the same areas;Expand existing studies, field monitoring, and analysis from local to larger areas, and from site- or species-specific impacts to more general ones. Further develop and deploy field monitoring activities, measuring multiple pressures and impacts on marine and coastal ecosystems and their services, as well as pollution, from installation to decommissioning and possible repowering, including operational phase and maintenance activities;Test and demonstrate field monitoring and modelling technologies that allow to go beyond state-of-knowledge, regarding life-cycle environmental impacts of offshore wind energy deployments;Improve instruments and models for Maritime Spatial Planning, and environmental assessments at plan and project level that are in alignment with public authorities’ needs;Improve modelling capacity and environmental impact assessments of future offshore wind deployment;Support the identification of areas where wind energy deployment is particularly suitable without significant environmental impact and areas where on the contrary, it should be avoided;Identify strategies, test, and demonstrate technologies that avoid, minimise, mitigate and compensate the environmental impact of bottom-fixed and floating offshore wind energy systems, propose mitigation and restoration measures and if feasible, provide net-positive environmental impacts. The activities carried out under this point are expected to achieve TRL 5 by the end of the project. Particular attention must be dedicated to ensuring that the data produced in the context of this topic is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable) and to leveraging"

Advanced biofuels and renewable fuels of non-biological origin are in EU’s portfolio of technologies that contribute to net-zero manufacturing in Europe. However, remaining challenges impacting the security of supply and competitiveness of these technologies and the integration of their value chains need to be clearly understood, presented, and mitigated.Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:Energy consumers benefit from the contribution to improved EU energy security and industrial competitiveness of renewable fuel technologies;Energy producers and consumers benefit from the improved reliability, robustness and security of renewable fuel technologies (compared to existing ones);Diverse stakeholders, e.g., policy makers, public authorities, citizens, researchers, and industry, profit from the enhancement of common knowledge and understanding about existing opportunities of integrated value chains for advanced biofuels and renewable fuels of non-biological origin;Multi stakeholders, e.g., policy makers, technology developers, researchers, industrial and any other relevant stakeholders to the value chain, profit from the generation of multi benefits of promoting sustainable development and sustainable agriculture regarding climate change resilience and regenerative practices, accelerating renewable fuel innovation, and maximising carbon removals. Scope:Projects are expected to assess the energy security and industrial competitiveness aspects of value chains for advanced biofuels and renewable fuels of non-biological origin, in view of the new situation in the EU regarding energy security and industrial competitiveness with the rest of the word. They are expected to also evaluate how these technologies could contribute to the EU’s energy security and industrial competitiveness through detailed value chain analysis and development of future scenarios, macroeconomic modelling, and strategic decision-making methods. Value chains closer to commercialisation with the potential to contribute more to the EU 2030 targets for green transition and industrial competitiveness and value chains for technologies under development with the potential to contribute to the longer term and could duly adopt mitigation measures, are both in scope. Proposals are expected to identify the research and innovation actions needed to improve the energy security and industrial competitiveness aspects of these value chains, and implement as appropriate research activities for such optimisation, as well as new standards definitions for advanced biofuels and RFNBOs as appropriate.Competitiveness, energy security and integration challenges of the various steps in a value chain and of the relevant stakeholders are expected to be addressed. Integration aspects encompass every step of each individual value chain and every stakeholder. Proposals are expected to coordinate efforts towards development of win-win integrated solutions of sustainable value chains for advanced biofuels and renewable fuels of non-biological origin engaging all relevant stakeholders, including as relevant farmers, CO2 suppliers, technology providers, researchers, fuel producers, end users, policy makers, international organisations. Multidisciplinary issues related to advanced biofuels and renewable fuels of non-biological origin production, carbon removals, CO2 trading and valorisation, sustainable farming, production of nature-based soil amendments, fertilizers, and organic materials, fuel standardisation, trade-off/synergies of carbon farming with in-situ carbon storing and of land uses for fuels versus solar panels for derived fuels, are expected to be considered, to achieve benefits for all through the integration.Value chains of renewable hydrogen as an end-product are not within the scope of this topic.A sustainability assessment of integrated solutions including techno-economic, environmental and social aspects is expected to be carried out based on life cycle analysis.Show more Topic descriptionExpected Outcome:European energy security and industrial competitiveness are contested by the geopolitical circumstances and market situations around the world.

Scope:Buildings result in greenhouse gas emissions over their whole life cycle (operational and embodied emissions). Buildings can also contribute to long-term carbon removals by storing carbon in construction products. Construction and renovation works must also meet a variety of inter-related requirements such as structural and fire safety, acoustics, and a healthy and comfortable indoor environment. Although much research has focused on developing materials and products with reduced whole life carbon emissions, the life cycle impacts of buildings depend on a complex interaction between individual products, components and technical building systems, spatial distribution, usage during their lifetime, and other design choices. There is therefore a need to deliver buildings and renovation works with minimal life cycle impacts, in particular global warming potential, based on circularity principles, also accommodating future building use-change through design for flexibility, and using innovative combinations of products and systems that result in optimal building-level performance.Proposals are expected to address all the following:Develop solutions that facilitate optimal combinations of construction products and systems with minimal life cycle environmental impacts at the level of the building. The optimal combinations of products and systems must also account for relevant aspects of performance such as structural integrity, thermal, acoustic and hygrometric, durability, potential for deconstruction and preparation for reuse at end of life, and potential for automated or industrialised installation. The solutions should cover, among others, the design and construction phases of work;Develop decision-related processes and strategies for adaptive reuse of existing structures, such as repurposing buildings as opposed to demolish and rebuild, considering the whole life carbon emissions; Validate the solutions, processes and strategies in a relevant environment in at least three countries, with different climatic conditions and building stock characteristics;Research the whole life carbon emissions of the developed solutions on typical building typologies in the chosen countries and contribute to whole life carbon benchmarking efforts;Consider the cost effectiveness of the developed solutions including relevant business models taking into consideration end-user needs;Contribute to the development of European standards[2], where relevant;Contribute to the objectives of the Built4People partnership and to the Built4People network of innovation clusters[3]. Selected proposals could consider the involvement of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) whose contribution could consist of providing added value on circular design and building solutions that reduce life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions, and enable carbon removals, as well as performing experimental research for validating those solutions on full-scale prototype buildings.This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘People-centric sustainable built environment’ (Built4People). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on results to the European Partnership ‘People-centric sustainable built environment’ (Built4People) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.[1] “Supporting the development of a roadmap for the reduction of whole life carbon of buildings”, European Union, 2023’. This publication commissioned by the European Commission includes the following definition: “Whole life carbon encompasses all greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the materials, construction and the use of a building over its entire life, including its demolition and disposal. It is thus the total amount of embodied and operational emissions.”[2] ‘harmonised standard’ means a standard adopted by one of the European standardisation bodies listed in Annex I to Directive 98/34/EC, on the basis of a request issued by the Commission, in accordance with Article 6 of that Directive[3] https://built4people.eu/nebula_project/Show more Topic descriptionExpected Outcome:Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:Measurable reduction in whole life carbon emissions[1] and uptake of carbon removals in buildings;Increased integration of circular approaches for building construction and renovation works, with the aim of minimising lifecycle impacts;Availability of more accurate benchmarks and calculations"

Scope:The challenge is the development and demonstration of cost-effective wave energy converters that can survive in a harsh and unpredictable ocean or sea environment through demand-driven pre-commercial procurement (PCP). The challenge is open to proposals seeking to steer wave energy development in an effective way at a European level and to bring these technologies to the market.The operation of wave energy prototypes in real sea conditions is a critical step to establish confidence in the devices and to facilitate the large-scale roll-out of this renewable technology. Pre-commercial procurement has been shown to be an effective tool to de-risk such activities.The EuropeWave PCP action has introduced the ocean energy stage-gate process on a European-level procedure following the evaluation framework provided by Task 12 of the IEA Ocean Energy System Technology Collaboration Platform. It supported the development of several wave energy devices in a stage-gate process to Stage 3 (approximately TRL 6). The scope of this action is to bring wave energy technologies at Stage 4 approximately TRL7/8). Designs must achieve completion of Stage 4 activities of the IEA-OES Framework Evaluation Areas by the end of the action, including technical, socio-economic, and sustainability aspects. Proposals have to describe their jointly identified challenge, indicating how it fits into their mid-to-long term innovation plans, and specify why solutions currently available on the market or under development are not meeting their needs.Activities have to include: (1) networking related to preparation, management and coordination and (2) joint research activities related to the validation of PCP strategy. The consortium should include at least three legal entities established in different member states or Horizon Europe associated countries, as well as a minimum of two 'public procurers'. Other entities with a clear added value in the preparation and/or execution of the PCP or in coordination and networking activities might be considered.The proposed action is to be structured as following:Preparation phase: Participating users/buyers of R&D services (with either a pan-European, national, or regional focus) should agree on a common set of performance levels and associated specifications for wave energy systems. The funding from the participating users/buyers and the European Union will be used to bring forward wave energy technologies and complete Stage 4 (reach TRL7/8). The procurement is open to any entities established in the EU or countries associated to Horizon Europe, and the proposed wave energy technology must be able to evidence the satisfactory completion of stage 3 activities as a minimum prior-development requirement (with or without the support of EuropeWave).

The PV market is changing fast, recently transitioning to high-efficiency crystalline silicon cell concepts (e.g., Tunnel Oxide Passivated Contact (TOPCon), Heterojunction (HJT), Interdigitated Back Contact (IBC), tandem, etc.), larger modules or novel designs (e.g., bifacial), use of new materials (e.g., anti-reflection and anti-soiling coatings, thinner glass, new encapsulants and backsheets), or increased number and topology of busbars or wires. There is no PV lifetime definition, but manufacturers usually guarantee a 25-year lifetime with an expected degradation rate of 0.8% per year. However, abnormal degradation rates are still reported for cell and module technologies due to a variety of failures which reduce reliability and increase the cost of PV systems operation.Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:Reduced degradation to levels that enable longer PV module lifetimes;Increased module durability and reliability;Resource efficiency and lifelong energy yield improvement of PV systems;Decreased levelised cost of electricity (LCOE);Execution of the solar energy joint research and innovation agenda[1]. Scope:The degradation rate might vary depending on many factors such as material properties, environmental stress (solar irradiance, humidity, temperature, wind speed, dust, etc.), installation, design and type of components and connections, with some components deteriorating on their own and others impacting additional PV components, leading to more severe failures. To tackle these issues and extend the lifetime of PV modules (and systems) proposals are expected to:Identify defects and failure modes encountered in recently developed high-efficiency or novel design c-silicon modules themselves and their components, exploring their mechanisms and root causes, reviewing each component’s susceptibility to defects and failures and impacting additional PV components;Develop, where necessary, simple, cost-effective and accurate module defect detection techniques (including through Artificial Intelligence (AI)), applicable to most PV modules and systems;Propose mitigation approaches at module and system level and validate approaches through modelling and/or AI modelling and lab testing;Perform outdoor field experiments and testing to determine degradation rates and/or to identify defects and failure modes and estimate service lifetime. Different locations representing the European range of climates are to be considered for field experiments.This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership for Innovation in Photovoltaics (EUPI-PV).

Tremendous efforts in material and device engineering have also increased moisture, heat, and light-related stability. All these features render perovskite solar modules suitable for terawatt-scale energy production with a low levelised cost of electricity (LCOE). A number of companies are working on PSCs and some of them, have been establishing new pilot production lines and/or expanding production capacity. Still, the greatest challenges toward commercialisation are scaling up (including ambient manufacturing), achieving long-term stability, reducing, or eliminating the use of toxic solvents, and preventing Pb leakage into the environment.Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:Increase the potential for commercialisation of perovskite PV creating competitive technological know-how for the European PV industrial base;Support a European economic base which is stronger, more resilient, competitive, and fit for the green and digital transitions, by reducing strategic dependencies for critical raw materials and components;Support the execution of the solar energy joint research and innovation agenda[1]. Scope:Metal halide perovskite solar cells have attracted much attention because of their low-cost fabrication and high efficiency. In addition, tandem devices, especially perovskite-Si tandems, are expected to play an important role in perovskite commercialisation. Poor stability of these devices remains however the key challenge in their path toward commercialisation. To overcome this issue, a robust encapsulation technique by employing suitable materials and structures with high barrier performance against the external environment must be developed to protect perovskite devices. Dedicated manufacturing processes and equipment need also be demonstrated. Therefore, proposals are expected to address all of the following aspects:Demonstrate effective strategies to enhance the optoelectronic properties, performance and stability, and minimise the environmental impact of perovskite devices;Scale-up reliable deposition of high-quality perovskite films over large areas, (overcoming the degradation of efficiency as device/module areas scale up) but also patterning and interconnections to connect individual cells into modules;Demonstrate internal and external encapsulation structures as protection from extrinsic environmental stressors, such as moisture, oxygen, heat, and illumination;Develop module designs considering recyclability requirements and restrictions as to the control and management of toxic Pb2+ that could be produced by the irreversible deterioration of the perovskite materials;Assess performance and reliability according to international standards and compared with well-established PV technologies; develop and apply test protocols for performance and reliability tailored to the features of perovskite and/or perovskite-Si tandem technology.Demonstrate suitable equipment adapted to the specific requirements of perovskite (or perovskite-Si tandem) production process. Proposals are expected to involve multidisciplinary consortia including at least one perovskite or equipment manufacturer.Whenever the expected exploitation of project results entails developing, creating, manufacturing and marketing a product or process, or in creating and providing a service, the plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results must include a strategy for such exploitation. The exploitation plan should include preliminary plans for scalability, commercialisation, and deployment (feasibility study, business plan) indicating the possible funding sources to be potentially used (in particular the Innovation Fund).This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership for Innovation in Photovoltaics (EUPI-PV).

Technology developers practice inclusive societal engagement which is early, continuous, and sensitive to the technical specificities (e.g. local resource, subsurface uncertainties) and social challenges (e.g. low public awareness) of underground thermal energy storage technologies in the context of densely populated urban areas. Scope:In scope are novel technologies, interfaces, design methods and organisational concepts that result in the most effective and sustainable use of subsurface space in dense urban areas by Underground Thermal Energy Storage (UTES) systems such as ATES, CTES and BTES.Proposals should consider the integration in the existing energy grids and interaction with other urban uses of the subsurface (e.g., subways, underground utilities, buildings), including energy geostructures of buildings, tunnels, slabs, energy sheet pile walls, etc., with potential geothermal heating, cooling, and sinks or storage opportunities.Proposals should address the uncertainties in the seasonal energy demand to increase the predictability of the required subsurface space, the interactions among systems for the sake of optimal use of subsurface and thermal efficiency.Projects are expected to deploy one or more demonstrators and can address, for example, one or more of the following exemplary areas: Optimal utilisation of geothermal resources and thermal energy storage in urban settings, addressing high (above 70 degrees Celsius), medium (30-70 degrees Celsius) and/or low temperatures (10-30 degrees Celsius) and possible requirements for retrofitting of the building stock;Subsurface models for a sustainable underground thermal storage and geothermal use in cities;The integration of heat pumps, advanced thermal storage, and interface with district heating infrastructures to contribute to the thermal and power grid flexibility;Studying the impact of subsurface urban heat islands (SUHI) on the potential of shallow geothermal energy use in cities, using, for instance, long-term subsurface monitoring networks, satellite monitoring and models;Best practices strategies for subsurface land-use plans in European cities; well/borehole placement strategies; Mutual interaction of existing and future neighbouring UTES systems from geotechnical, energy, and regulatory point of view;Management of energy grids on an urban scale and system optimisation thorough digital twins predicting operational, environmental and economic response, as well as the interaction between the storage system and the local grids, under different scenarios;Creation of large (time and scale-wise) open multisensory datasets to foster heat energy storage at the European scale which should adhere to the FAIR data principles, adopt data quality standards, data integration operating procedures and GDPR-compliant data sharing/access good practices developed by the European research infrastructures, where relevant. Use of advanced monitoring systems such as fibre optic sensors, satellite imagery, etc. for monitoring and early detection of adverse impact of UTES at a district scale level and providing measures to mitigate such effects. Consideration should be given to de-risking solutions, and dedicated support schemes that guide innovative energy storage technologies through to the commercialisation stage. The consortium should assess the current regulatory context and provide recommendations linked to the proposed solutions for shaping future needs (e.g., regulatory, standardisation, permitting). In addition, appropriate local community engagement initiatives as well as expectations and experiences of underground thermal storage infrastructures (and to what extent it varies in dense urban areas) should be explored.This topic requires citizens engagement and dialogue and the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities and ensure the translation of innovation into real-life outputs.Show more Topic descriptionExpected Outcome:Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes: Advanced European innovative knowledge basis and increased technology competitiveness in the area thermal storage;Improved security of the future European renewable-based energy system;Contribution to the decarbonisation of cities and densely populated urban areas with high safety solutions;Significant reduction of LCOHS (Levelised Cost of Heat Storage); Local communities are engaged and their expectations are responded to.

Scope:Development of new or emerging capture technologies with high potential for cost reduction. Proposals shall address capture of CO2 either from one of the following areas (and explicitly identify which is being covered): Point sources, orDirectly from air (direct air capture, DAC). Depending on the capture routes chosen (e.g., solvents, sorbents, membranes, cryogenic, solid looping), examples of important issues to address include enhanced absorption/adsorption, improved kinetics and reduced energy use for CO2 capture and desorption, new materials with high selectivity for CO2 capture, flexibility of operation, modularisation and scale-up, space occupation, degradation and life span of capture materials, ability for retrofit, potential for heat integration, and solvent-induced corrosion.In particular for DAC, examples of important issues to address are novel sorbent or solvent materials that have higher CO2 capture capacities and longer-term stability in the presence of heat and air. For all proposals, minimisation of health and environmental impact must be addressed in the project also in view of future scaling up. The developed technologies should aim at delivering CO2 at the specifications required for transport and storage, with very low levels of impurities.For point-source capture, the technologies should address the performance profile and characteristic when operating under variable operating conditions such as load changes to maintain and as high as possible capture rate across the entire operating profile. Results from point-source capture should provide good matches between specific industrial application and capture technology while guaranteeing the quality and continuity of the industrial process.The use of the European Research Infrastructure for CO2 Capture, Utilisation, Transport and Storage ECCSEL is encouraged but not mandatory.In particular for DAC, international cooperation with participating countries of the Mission Innovation Carbon Dioxide Removal Mission[1] is encouraged.[1] Carbon Dioxide Removal – Mission Innovation (mission-innovation.net)Show more Topic descriptionExpected Outcome:Project results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:New capture technologies (either from points sources or directly from air) should lead to reduced overall cost of capture, as well as lowest possible negative environmental impact, including water use.

Scope:Electronic Freight Transport Information (eFTI) platforms established in line with Regulation 2020/1056 will play a central role in facilitating the implementation of business-to-authority (B2A) information exchange processes related to multimodal transport of goods. In line with the Regulation’s requirements, common specifications for a single comprehensive data set and harmonised protocols for data sharing will ensure interoperability of the information shared electronically between actors, and the requirements for rights-based access-control system will establish safeguards for cybersecurity and trust. The use of electronic means to exchange regulatory information is also expected to reduce administrative costs for economic operators, to enhance the efficiency of freight transport services and to facilitate green transformation of the logistics sector.Therefore, given their potential, apart from specific B2A functionalities, eFTI platforms could also serve as an enabler for other universal, open and affordable solutions and tools to achieve digital interconnectivity of logistics systems and platforms including in a business-to-business (B2B) perspective.The proposals should unlock the potential of eFTI platforms for further functionalities, beyond the scope of Regulation 2020/1056, to new B2B services and applications as well as other B2A uses.Proposals should refer, as a core principle, to the legislative framework and specific technological solutions provided through Regulation 2020/1056, while duly reflecting the latest technological state of the art for electronic information exchange. Where relevant, and especially in B2B perspective, they should apply and build upon the concepts and solutions developed in other Union initiatives aimed to facilitate data sharing and exchange in transport, the Digital Transport and Logistics Forum (DTLF) and the European mobility data space (EMDS).Outside the scope of this topic is any type of architecture, federation of platforms or similar, as these are already delivered by eFTI and DTLF. Proposals also should not develop functionalities already required in the current scope of the eFTI Regulation.

Scope:CCAM-enabled vehicles are constantly sensing their surroundings on road conditions, location, nearby vehicles and infrastructure. Such data is shared in real-time, while data from other sources is received. This needs powerful and optimised large data processing algorithms, which requires large amounts of computing power, data processing, real-time operation and high levels of security. However, most existing AI computing tasks for automated vehicle applications are relying on general-purpose hardware, which has limitations in terms of power consumption, speed, accuracy, scalability, memory footprint, size and cost. Hardware advancements driven by initiatives such as the Chips JU calls must be complemented by significant efforts to optimise AI algorithms for CCAM functionalities, ensuring their efficient performance on edge-specific hardware.To encompass CCAM solutions in future steps towards e.g., the Software Defined Vehicle, this dual approach on AI advancements and hardware advancements is essential. Complementarities with projects funded under Cluster 4 “Digital Industry and Space” of Horizon Europe should also be considered where appropriate, especially in translating sector-agnostic innovations to the specificities of CCAM applications. Requirements on AI algorithm optimisation, latency, on-board energy availability, solutions to gain unbiased datasets for AI training, Electronic Control Unit (ECU) capacity and on potential safety-critical scenarios should be considered to ensure the timely triggering of actions, and in a later stage, anticipatory driving. Solutions should use, as far as possible, building blocks, interfaces, and tools from projects of the Software-Defined Vehicle of the Future (SDVoF) initiative.Edge-AI involves deploying AI algorithms on edge computing devices, which are hardware systems constrained in proximity to the data source where they operate. This is done without relying on remote resources for the computational efforts. It thus facilitates real-time insights, responses and triggering of actions, with reduced costs as the processing power close to the application is used, greatly reducing networking costs. Combining AI with edge-AI can facilitate stable solutions to include the full activity chain from sensing, perception, decision-making up to actuation of advanced CCAM solutions, gaining speed and resilience which are essential in safety-critical situations.To successfully overcome these challenges, proposed actions are expected to address all of the following aspects:For next major advancements in AI applications in CCAM solutions, huge AI applications need to fit into limited hardware, to make it fit for purpose. Edge-AI devices often have limited computational resources, making it challenging to deploy large and complex AI models. Thus, it is essential to develop and reshape approaches and building blocks for CCAM solutions, viable to be run on edge-hardware. Use cases for the approaches and building blocks should focus on time-critical applications (such as the chain from (collective) perception, decision making and actuation of functionalities) and can be linked to the activities and results from projects AI4CCAM[1] and AIthena[2].Develop optimised edge-AI algorithms and demonstrate their applicability and scalability, using real-world CCAM scenarios such as in the databases resulting from projects such as SYNERGIES[3]. The development and demonstration use case should include in-vehicle perception and understanding, such as object detection, segmentation, road surface tracking, sign and signal recognition, etc. Decision making and actuation of countermeasures is to be part of the chain of actions.

Scope:The field of aircraft icing is of particular importance because it relates to the safety of flight facing adverse weather conditions, which became increasingly extreme during the last decade.The aviation industry is working to develop clean and sustainable aviation. There is the need to innovate while maintaining safety.To enable design, validation and future certification of new technologies emerging from cleaner aviation, R&I should be initiated on the following three principal areas ( proposals should consider addressing all, or significant areas of all, three areas):1. R&I to prepare for the development of means of compliance for certification of future sustainable aviation concepts including:Development of reliable numerical tools to be used to validate the designs against the icing environment of Appendix C, O, P and snow, including ground anti-icing fluids;Development of Supercooled Large Drop (SLD) Testing Capabilities such as icing wind tunnel test or ice tankers. Generation of flight-testing open datasets for validation of modelling and tunnel testing;Development of European Ice Crystal test Capability (for engine/air data probe);Development of Falling / Blowing Snow Testing Capability. 2. R&I on Icing environment to assess the impact of the climate change effects on the certification icing environments[1].3. R&I related to new technologies for Ice detection and protection, including:Ice crystal and SLDs Ice Detection systems to optimise Ice crystals protection or support the detect and exit the SLD appendix O or a portion of the appendix O conditions;High Efficiency/Low Energy protection: cleaner aviation with more electric airplanes will drive the need for new ice protection technology: more effective and with less energy, active, passive and hybrid technologies (e.g., low ice-adhesion durable coatings and including new air mobility products (e.g., low speed propeller icing concerns);Dissimilar means for Air data (angle of attack (AOA)/Speed) measurement and insensitive to icing threat. Air speed and aircraft attitude measurements are crucial for aircraft control. Air data/navigation probes are externally mounted and exposed to adverse conditions. Dissimilar means to determine the aircraft speed and altitude would provide benefits and make the air data system even more robust and fault tolerant to environmental conditions (icing or hail);Enhanced aircraft performance and in particular ice protection health monitoring by improving the ice protection system monitoring coverage based on smart systems capable to monitor a large number of aircraft parameters.

Scope:The initial deployment of Level 4 automated vehicle services in urban and other complex settings has encountered significant challenges in environmental perception and decision-making, leading to occasional remote assistance calls, blockages and accidents that have impacted public trust. At the same time, the increasing computing power demand is in conflict with a limited usage of energy and resources to meet sustainability requirements. Thus, emerging large-scale demonstrations of automated vehicles should be accompanied by objective-oriented research aimed at addressing these challenges directly, while targeting improvements in performance, accuracy, reliability, and cyber-security.To successfully overcome these challenges, proposed actions for this topic are expected to address all of the following aspects:Advancements in all steps of the sense-control-act process for both vehicle- and infrastructure-based smart sensor systems and networks, controllers, and actuators to ensure safety and trustworthiness of CCAM, as well as facilitating effective disruption management;Utilisation of digital enabling technologies including, for example: AI at-the-edge, machine learning, data spaces with reference scenarios and suitable software architectures[1];Adoption of modular, reusable, and open software platforms supporting the environment perception for CCAM while ensuring transparency of operation, verification, and safety assessment to build trust, with respect to authorities, decision makers and the public via direct performance explainability;Energy efficiency, circularity, and eco-design of the environment perception systems by decreasing potential energy and resource consumption in both production and operation as well as facilitating reusability, reparability and upgradability while further enhancing the performance;Reduction of potential costs of environment perception systems through scalability, modularity and standardisation, making technologies financially viable for widespread implementation;Support remote assistance as a stepping-stone towards higher levels of autonomy and vehicle automation in wider Operational Design Domains (ODD). Solutions are expected to integrate electronic hardware architectures and software stacks in a co-design approach. Hence, it is strongly encouraged that solutions use, as far as possible, building blocks and tools from projects of the Software-Defined Vehicle of the Future (SDVoF) initiative under the Chips Joint Undertaking, e.g., on the hardware abstraction layer and SDV middleware and API framework. Results from projects funded under HORIZON-CL5-2024-D6-01-04[2] and complementarities with projects funded under Horizon Europe Cluster 4 “Digital Industry and Space” should also be considered, where appropriate.As the activities should demonstrate feasibility and their full potential for real-world applications, proposals should foresee exchanges with other relevant EU or national projects for e.g., coordinated validation, transport systems integration and large-scale piloting. Collaboration should also be sought with projects funded under HORIZON-CL5-2024-D6-01-01[3] and other directly relevant call topics.In view of the relevance of environment perception and decision-making of automated vehicles for the responsiveness of the innovation to diverse societal interests and concerns, accessibility, inclusiveness as well as regulation, proposals should consider societal, ethical, socio-economical and/ or legal aspects as far as feasible in the requirements of the technical solutions to be developed.

Scope:This topic aims to reduce development costs and time to market of new battery systems by accelerated multi-physical and virtual testing. Current test strategies are still very time consuming and costly due to the need to understand the impact of multi-physical operational loads (electric, thermal, mechanical, etc.), potential failure modes, ageing and misuse on the safety and reliability of battery cells and modules.To overcome these barriers, new multi-physical test strategies supplemented by virtual testing are required taking into account the most impactful parameters on ageing, reliability and safety and their dependencies.Proposals are expected to address Electric Vehicle (EV) batteries and are encouraged to develop techniques and methodologies which are applicable to other forms of electro-mobility as well as stationary applications (including second life).Proposals are expected to address and demonstrate all the following activities:Understand and describe the impact of multi-physical operational loads, failure modes, ageing and misuse on battery reliability and safety highlighting the dependencies between them in order to design the most adequate testing methods and parameters;Derive advanced operating profiles for testing and development of novel X-in-the-Loop (XiL) test environments for multi-physical and accelerated testing addressing electrical, thermal and mechanical loads at the same time;Combine physics-based with data-driven test strategies enabling reliable virtual and physical battery testing considering specific applications;Develop simplified test strategies reducing the number of tests and their complexity while improving battery safety and reliability. Synergies between different battery chemistries, including next generation battery designs and sizes must be exploited where possible, allowing to re-use or scale test results from cell to system level;Research activities are also expected to lead to advanced response strategies for damaged and aged batteries. Furthermore, a contribution to the European safety classification system is expected by developing standards for this safety classification. To this end, proposals are expected to establish contact and exploit complementarities with selected proposals under topic HORIZON-CL5-2025-04-D5-03 “Safe post-crash management of road Light Duty Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) (2ZERO Partnership)” with regards to monitoring techniques for safety risks, algorithms for defining state of health and remaining useful life. Activities covering the following aspects are encouraged:Development of virtual methods for full system validation using physical sub-system results;Development, exploitation, and harmonisation of advanced battery cell or pack measurement and diagnostic methods for enhancing the data depth and breadth over what is currently available. Definition of performance indicators relating to battery degradation and safety, and development of methods for the validation of digital models.Application of AI and generative AI for the definition of the design of experimental and testing strategies to increase the outcome of experimental testing campaigns, in order to accelerate achievement of significant conclusions, and to thus reduce testing time and effort. Whenever the expected exploitation of project results entails developing, creating, manufacturing and marketing a product or process, or in creating and providing a service, the plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results must include a strategy for such exploitation.

Scope:Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from transport represent around 25% of total man-made GHG emissions and continue to grow. The negative impact of these is further strengthened by the existence of other external costs of transport, including air pollution, noise, congestion and accidents. The EU, Member States and industry have made considerable efforts to reduce transport-related GHG emissions and associated external costs.Accurate and reliable information on emissions is an important tool to increase effectiveness of specific emission reduction measures undertaken by public authorities and businesses. Over the past 15 years, a lot of progress has been made at EU level and globally through new regulatory actions and continuing collaboration between actors to improve the transparency of transport GHG emissions and external costs monitoring. This is manifested through:Regulatory initiatives including Regulation (EU) 2023/1805 (FuelEU Maritime)[1], Regulation (EU) 2023/2405 (ReFuelEU Aviation)[2], Regulation (EU) 2015/757 (EU MRV)[6] and especially, the recent Commission’s proposal for the Regulation on the accounting of greenhouse gas emissions of transport services (CountEmissions EU)[3], and Directive (EU) 2023/2413 (Renewable Energy Directive);Relevant EU research projects, including “Carbon Footprint of Freight Transport” (COFRET), “Logistics Emissions Accounting & Reduction Network” (LEARN) and the on-going “Creating Legitimate Emission Factors for Verified GHG Emission Reductions in Transport” (CLEVER)[8];Standardisation work, including ISO 14083, the official international standard developed between November 2019 and October 2022 and published in March 2023 as part of the 14000 family of ISO GHG-related standards[9];Regular updates of the Handbook on the External Costs of Transport[10];Industry initiatives, such as the Global Logistics Emissions Council (GLEC) Framework, the industry-led guideline for GHG calculation and reporting in the global logistics sector. Building on the initiatives listed above, proposals should undertake further work to ensure that:The full climate impact of transport operations is covered in a comprehensive and consistent way;Relevant open items identified in the emissions accounting reference methodology set out under the Commission’s proposal on CountEmissions EU can be scientifically clarified and closed;Any detailed tweaks to the methodology that have come to light through application can be developed and tested in view of the implementation of the CountEmissions EU framework;New technologies, such as generative Artificial Intelligence, are considered in developing datasets and methodologies;Relevant data is available for the proper implementation and seamless integration of requirements set in other EU climate related legislation in transport, including Regulations on Fuel EU Maritime, ReFuelEU Aviation, EU MRV, and Regulation (EU) 2020/1056 on electronic freight transport information[11]. The Action will play a central role in contributing to the establishment of an unambiguous scientific framework aimed to tackle emissions in transport. However, the Action should also facilitate alignment between EU policy development and market implementation, especially towards enabling market-based accounting approaches that would support proactive investment in low emission fuels and associated transport services. The proposals should address all of the following aspects:Explore, assess and establish the state of the art regarding issues of measuring and calculating specific types of transport-related emissions for which there is no clear consensus on the market, in particular: black carbon emissions, which primarily result from the combustion of fossil fuels in compression ignition engines; radiative forcing, which has been suggested as having a strong supplementary climate impact at high altitude and is already included in an inconsistent manner across some, but not all, transport GHG reporting programs; GHG emissions from vehicle manufacturing and scrappage, which, although not directly linked to transport operations, do contribute to overall life cycle transport emissions; GHG emissions that result from the installation of transport infrastructure, which would need to include the definition of rules for the combination of operational and life cycle emission calculations into a"

Scope:The scope covers quasi-solid and all-solid-state lithium-ion battery technologies (up to 5% liquid electrolyte weight percentage) which encompasses Si-C composite anodes or lithium metal anodes.Process-Specific Machinery and Technological UpgradesProjects are expected to identify and target at least one key manufacturing process for enhancement, and to focus on optimising and testing the specific critical process(es) within existing production lines rather than overhauling the entire production system. These processes must be critical to the transition from liquid electrolyte to solid-state batteries and have the potential for high-impact improvements in terms of production yield, quality, cost, and sustainability including energy consumption.Projects are expected to cover all of the following tasks:Provide detailed plans on how existing machinery and systems can be adapted to optimise the chosen process, ensuring that these enhancements are both impactful and economically viable;Modify existing machinery to better support the specialised requirements of the targeted process. This includes enhancing capabilities to handle new materials and designs efficiently;Develop and implement technological innovations that specifically enhance the chosen process, such as precision manufacturing tools and additive manufacturing. Feasibility and Impact ValidationProjects are expected to conduct pilot testing to validate the feasibility and benefits of the enhancements on the chosen process. Proposals are expected to include clear metrics for evaluating improvements, such as reductions in energy consumption, increases in production yield, and enhancements in product consistency.Projects are encouraged to evaluate the impact of the new or improved process on other steps in the manufacturing line, including any necessary modifications to adjacent processes, or across other parts of the production line and in different manufacturing environments.Advanced Materials and Cell Design IntegrationProjects are expected to tailor the design of the produced cell to maximise the benefits of the improved process. This can be done through the development of new advanced materials or through the integration of existing materials to improve the targeted manufacturing process.Digitalisation, Data Integration and Analytics and Process ControlProjects are expected to cover at least one of the following tasks:Implement advanced control systems and digital technologies that are specifically designed to optimise the chosen process, improving efficiency, and reducing waste;Develop new process simulation methods, process models and materials chemistry models allowing to virtually assess novel cell designs’ flexible manufacturability at scale for adapted existing plants. In addition, projects are encouraged to leverage data analytics and data-driven approaches (artificial intelligence) to enhance decision-making and process optimisation, focusing on the specific needs and challenges of the targeted process.Whenever the expected exploitation of project results entails developing, creating, manufacturing and marketing a product or process, or in creating and providing a service, the plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results must include a strategy for such exploitation. The exploitation plans are expected to include preliminary plans for scalability, commercialisation, and deployment (feasibility study, business plan).Proposals could consider the involvement of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC)[1] whose contribution could consist of performing experimental research on battery performance and/or safety.

Scope:The share of trips made by active modes is increasing, which is in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. This increase is linked to cities actively placing more focus on the mobility and safety needs of pedestrians, cyclists, e-cyclists and users of other micro-mobility device, which materialises in new regulations, and in new or improved infrastructure. However, pedestrians and cyclists remain heavily affected by crashes. Concurrently, the use of electrically assisted devices (such as e-bikes, e-scooters, e-cargo bikes, mobility systems used by people with disabilities, etc.) – to be referred to as micromobility modes – is increasing exponentially because these modes represent an efficient means of personal mobility, as well as a new and effective mode for the last-mile delivery of goods within the city area. Micromobility modes, shared and owned, have been adopted by commuters, tourists, the elderly, food and goods delivery companies, and come in varying sizes and operating speeds. When their use emerged, micromobility modes were associated with high hospitalisation rates, mainly for the micromobility users themselves, but also pedestrians and cyclists. While efforts have been made to regularise and standardise these vehicles, especially in the case of shared e-scooters, there is still a significant knowledge gap related to the operational safety of these vehicles in cities.Proposals submitted under this topic should address all of the following aspects:Collect and use exposure data when analysing the safety of pedestrians, cyclists, and micromobility users, and identify crash contributing factors and their interactions;Provide an extensive analysis of the safety needs, as well as tailored safety measures for cyclists and each type of micromobility mode (e.g. shared e-scooters versus owned e-bikes), while taking into account the trip purpose (e.g. recreational ride versus delivery of goods), and the socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of the users;Assess the actual and perceived safety risk of pedestrians and cyclists due to the emergence of micromobility modes that operate at higher speeds and that have increased in size and weight;Quantify the impact of the geometric design, quality, and continuity of the cycling infrastructure on the safety of cyclists, pedestrians and micromobility users, considering their increasing demand, operating speeds, and size of vehicles;Assess the potential effectiveness of vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technologies in decreasing conflicts and near misses between pedestrians, cyclists and micromobility vehicles, and users and motorised vehicles;Identify best practices in the design of bicycles and micromobility vehicles in terms of stability and the avoidance of single crashes, contributing to the underlying development of a"

the Smart and Sustainable Mobility Strategy as well as the implementation of the Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission, project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:Real-time demonstration of on-board tamper-proof and remote measurement techniques for a wide range of pollutants (including pollutants from alternative fuels and non-regulated pollutants) from vessel emissions, allowing shipowners to measure the emissions during operation and contributing to the current monitoring and enforcing activities of public authorities, such as port and maritime authorities and with the potential to be used for future compliance monitoring;Development of broadly accepted harmonised methods to measure real sailing emissions, including coastal, open seas and inland waterway with potential to be used for future compliance monitoring;Development of an automatic reporting and verification system solution that helps shipping companies to comply with current and future regulation and for maritime, inland and port authorities to monitor and control the actual ship emissions derived from the data exchanged;Contribution to the delivery of better emission factors for emissions inventories and projections, especially for harmful substances and fuel mixtures for which little knowledge exists today and ultimately contributing to the establishment of a broadly accepted method for measuring and calculating real sailing emissions of a ship;Identification of real-world releases of harmful substances which are currently not controlled by regulations and excessive releases of substances already controlled in open seas and in-port activities;Innovative technologies and systems to monitor, measure and identify the source of pollution in ports beyond vessels, including other transport modes, port operations and industries active in the port environment are made available for public authorities;Recommendations for improved certification and testing to better cover real world situations;Support of local, regional, national and international emissions reduction and air quality plans and noise action plans by providing real-world emission information and measuring the actual impact of control measures and strategies on concentrations and/or deposition of pollutants;Identification of risk areas for potential violations to emission limits. Scope:There is a pressing need to measure accurately the different types of emissions in coastal and port environments located near to cities, because of their negative impact on the environment and human health. Ports, as intricate environments showcasing a variety of vessels including novel designs, pose a challenge to the development of standardised technologies capable of collecting and assessing real-time pollutant emissions data from these ships docking at ports. This is vital for enforcing emissions limits and validating the data for enforcement purposes.Moreover, emissions in ports stem from other sources, such as port operations (e.g., cargo handling, towing, fuel storage, and bunkering) or even other industrial activities (directly or indirectly linked to transport, e.g., fisheries) taking place within the port area. Additionally, ports are frequently situated near industrial zones, making it crucial to possess an accurate and, where possible, real-time understanding of the types, origins, and intensity of pollutant and noise emissions generated in and around a port area.The shift from heavy fuel oils to alternative fuels in the context of the regulatory framework[1] set to achieve the objectives of the Green Deal requires further research actions; recent evidence from research and monitoring projects has shown that new fuels being considered and GHG emission-control technologies used on-board vessels may result in emissions of other harmful pollutants that are not sufficiently controlled. In some cases, unexpected side effects of emission abatement may arise which might require regulatory action[2].Further to such undesired releases, it is crucial to ensure that vessels comply with regulations in force, in coastal areas, at open sea and in inland waterways. Projects under call LC-MG-1-1-2018 of Horizon 2020 showed that remote measurement of SOx emissions using stationary or mobile techniques can significantly increase the cost-effectiveness of compliance monitoring. It is important to explore whether remote or on-board techniques can be extended to the monitoring of additional pollutants such as CH4, NOx, N2O, NH3, UFP, BC, formaldehyde, PM[3], as well as the Particle Number (PN), NPAHs and to provide internationally harmonised methods and reporting procedures where such measurements can be used within an enhanced compliance monitoring framework in the future.

Scope:Data sharing plays a pivotal role in supporting R&I, enabling deployment, and enhancing the competitiveness of the CCAM industry. Within the realm of data sharing, there are two distinct categories of data that are particularly pertinent: mobility data, and data for research and development. The common European mobility data space[1] aims to facilitate mobility data access and sharing, and is supported by projects, notably from the Digital Europe Programme. This mobility data space will facilitate the sharing of data related to mobility patterns, traffic flow, and other macroscopic aspects that are essential for the development of CCAM solutions. Within the research, testing and deployment of CCAM solutions for the automotive as well as infrastructure sectors, there is a need for a dedicated data space tailored specifically to the requirements of CCAM stakeholders. This CCAM Data Space demands a more granular and extensive array of data to cater to the needs of both Tier X suppliers, Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), traffic managers and infrastructure providers, particularly in terms of vehicle and traffic safety considerations. Specific aspects related to ongoing regulatory developments would need to be considered (e.g. Automated Driving Systems and General Safety regulations, adaption of type approval to the AI Act, including trustworthy AI integration).Several data spaces exist or are being developed in Europe for CCAM in specific R&I initiatives. The FAME[2] project has released a CCAM Data Sharing Framework (DSF) 2.0 describing best practices in data sharing and will develop a CCAM Federated Data Space as a proof of concept to facilitate the exchange of research and test data across R&I projects. Several CCAM Partnership R&I projects expressed interest in making data available and reusing data from other projects through the FAME Test Data Space, once it will be operational. The scenario-based validation approach for safety argumentation in highly automated functions will result in an integration of various scenario databases facilitated by a federated layer, as developed in project SUNRISE[3] and SYNERGIES[4]. However, this integration falls short of constituting a comprehensive Data Space approach, both for new data sets and extensions of existing datasets. To achieve full Data Space functionality for CCAM, significant enhancements are required in terms of developing connectors, APIs, and protocols for seamless data exchange. Additionally, there is a need to refine user profile management systems and establish robust contractual frameworks to govern data access and usage rights. A generic data space blueprint and building blocks are being developed and governed by the Data Space Support Centre[5]. In parallel, the DeployEMDS[6] builds a decentralised technical infrastructure and common governance mechanisms for urban mobility use cases in 9 cities and regions across Europe.Consequently, substantial efforts are necessary to fully integrate these approaches into a cohesive and efficient Data Space environment that can effectively support the diverse needs of the CCAM research community and industry. Moreover, extensive datasets are also indispensable for the development of low-level modules such as driver monitoring systems, perception systems, and decision-making algorithms, as well as for sensors like GNSS, radar, cameras, and lidar. While projects like AIthena[7] and AWARE2ALL[8] have generated valuable datasets, the lack of centralised storage and access hampers their utility. Therefore, there is a strong need to incorporate such datasets into a unified CCAM Data Space that is aligned with the data space blueprint, taking advantage of the common building blocks. By"

The project is expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:The European Commission has a comprehensive overview on the way Societal Readiness is addressed and integrated in piloted projects, and main challenges and concerns are identified;A proven strategy to intensify collaboration between STEM[1] and SSH[2] partners led to in-depth interdisciplinary work in R&I projects. All involved project constituencies and relevant parts of society are accounted for in an integrated way to ensure broad and sustainable support for R&I solutions;The next generation of Societal Readiness projects benefits from current pilot projects’ experiences, success stories and do’s and don’ts thanks to a public web platform, acting as a one-stop-shop for Societal Readiness for future EU projects;The European Commission is equipped with a sound, clear, and replicable procedure – both at implementation and content level – presented as an improvement of the current approach, to address Societal Readiness effectively in future EU funded R&I projects. Scope:The European Commission has a strong interest in learning from the implementation of Societal Readiness actions piloted in eight topics from the Cluster 5 work programme 2025[3], and resulting in an estimate of eighteen projects to be implemented. Conclusions on the pilot’s monitoring and evaluation will be the basis for the European Commission’s decision to replicate further these actions, to improve its implementation and possibly widen its use to other fields of application.The instructions and definitions applying to pilot topics are included in the introduction of the Horizon Europe Main Work Programme 2025 for Climate, Energy and Mobility.The action is expected to analyse the way Societal Readiness is addressed and integrated in piloted projects and help in designing an efficient, clear, and impactful way of applying a Societal Readiness approach in future EU funded R&I projects with a true interdisciplinary collaboration.The project selected should address all of the following actions:Make a consolidated analysis: on the way Societal Readiness is considered and integrated in the Descriptions of the Actions[4] of selected pilot-projects in terms of content (e.g., the type of Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) guiding questions chosen and related methodology), implementation (e.g., SR related work distribution and partners) and methodology. Assess the level, timing, and quality of interactions between SSH and STEM partners during the proposal preparation.of all First reports on Societal Readiness to be delivered by the selected pilot-projects. Assess the way SR consideration unfolds from the Description of the Actions’ methodology, observe how guiding questions are addressed and plan to respond to the concerns identified. Compare the various ‘SR visions’ put forward by each consortium.of all Final reports on Societal Readiness to be delivered by the selected pilot-projects. Assess the various projects’ experiences, challenges and lessons learned during the actual implementation of the Societal Readiness activities, looking at the participation and type of external actors in co-design methods, responses to SR guiding questions, possible adjustment of R&I activities. Mid-project recommendations based on the two first points are expected in order to give a preliminary sense of directionality for future Societal Readiness projects.Analyse the various interdisciplinarity mechanisms (SSH vs. STEM, collaboration with societal stakeholders) across pilot-projects as well as their effectiveness in practice. Identify successful interdisciplinary approaches and less successful ones. Possible evolutions in partners behaviours, or changes in interdisciplinary strategies should be identified. The degree of involvement from partners in SR activities, as well as the way they perceive them (in a positive or negative way) should also be scrutinised. This analysis should result in a publication with concrete tips helping future project partners integrating implementable, efficient, and well-accepted interdisciplinary practices both within consortia and towards external actors.Organise annual workshops in physical format to allow all pilot project representatives to meet, interact and exchange experiences periodically. Travel costs for all participants are to be covered by this action.Set up a public web platform during the action duration, to provide a direct source of support to future SR users, including examples of SR pathways, do’s and don’ts, tips and tricks specifically tailored to facilitate the use and understanding of"

Application of such human behavioural models in the virtual safety validation of CCAM systems to realistically represent the behaviour of human-driven vehicles in closed loop simulations of mixed traffic, thereby reflecting the variety of human driving behaviour, including behaviour in complex real-world and emergency conditions. Scope:The deployment of CCAM systems in mixed traffic will mean intense interaction with all road users such as the human drivers of other vehicles as well as pedestrians and riders of two-wheelers. These interactions (including implicit and explicit communication by humans and CCAM systems) will play a crucial role in the acceptance and thereby the penetration of CCAM systems in future road transport. CCAM systems will have to show safe and human-like driving behaviour, so that their decisions and actions can be anticipated easily by all road users, respecting the variety of typical driving behaviour across different countries as well as the need for CCAM systems to respect traffic rules and support road safety.This will require validated models of explicit and implicit human driving behaviour to design and validate such system behaviour. These models will be needed in closed loop simulations of CCAM systems in mixed traffic to realistically represent the reactions of human drivers in other vehicles to the behaviour of a CCAM system. Models representing human driving behaviour are being developed by the projects i4Driving[1] and BERTHA[2] for selected fields of application, i.e. they will be calibrated for a limited number of scenarios. Bringing together and building upon the results of these projects – in particular a simulation library and an innovative methodology to account for uncertainty from i4Driving and a scalable, probabilistic driver behavioural model from BERTHA, research is needed to extend the fields of application that these projects are addressing with a focus on representing driver behaviour in a multitude of safety-critical scenarios, considering the variation and statistical distribution of human behavioural patterns and the factors influencing such behaviour, including the parallel execution of non-driving related tasks.To achieve high degrees of robustness and applicability in a wide range of scenarios, detailed calibration and parameterisation is necessary, as driver behaviour depends on factors such as the road infrastructure, vehicle types, traffic conditions and rules, as well as regional influences and driver experiences / demographics, e.g., gender, age and other relevant social variables. Considering the deviation of average from ideal human driving behaviour, proposed actions must also validate the models for their extended fields of application, going well beyond the applications and degrees of validation accomplished by the above-mentioned projects under HORIZON-CL5-2022-D6-01-03. Proposed actions are thus expected to raise the technology readiness of such models to TRL 5. Data for parameterisation and validation should be captured by monitoring real human drivers in driving simulators and/or real traffic considering what is happening inside and outside the vehicle.Proposed actions should integrate, to the extent possible, the validated models in the virtual validation and verification approaches as developed in the projects HEADSTART[3] and SUNRISE[4] and complemented by the project SYNERGIES[5]. Successful integration should be demonstrated in various safety-relevant scenarios as provided by the action(s) funded under HORIZON-CL5-2023-D6-01-02[6]. Models should be shared via the federated data exchange platform for CCAM to be developed by an action under HORIZON-CL5-2025-D6-06[7].Proposals are encouraged to also explore additional fields of application of validated driver behaviour models, while the integration of relevant expertise from social sciences and humanities (SSH) is expected.To achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is encouraged with research stakeholders in Japan and the United States but also with other relevant strategic partners in third countries. Such cooperation should exploit synergies as far as possible in capturing data for"

Scope:One of the principles of the Safe System Approach is to turn from mainly re-active to pro-active management of road safety, i.e. not to derive needs for intervention primarily from crash investigations, but to intervene before serious crashes happen. The ubiquitous gathering of ever-growing amounts of data and their processing in the digital transport system support this idea providing valuable information on traffic situations and events. Potential data sources include amongst others: smart phones, wearables, connected vehicles, drones, road-side sensors (e.g. camera, radar), etc. Progress in computing power, in the accuracy of location services and in video analytics are further enablers in the processing and analysis of such data in order to identify safety-critical situations or conflicts based on surrogate safety metrics.In terms of crash prediction modelling artificial intelligence has the potential to identify the underlying risk and the complex relationships between large and diverse datasets which in turn could lead to the identification of crash contributing factors and their interrelations. The identification of these risk factors may then allow predicting safety-critical situations at quantifiable risk levels and guide the proactive implementation of crash avoidance measures, as proposed amongst others by the International Transport Forum at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Ideally, interventions would be feasible in real-time and increase the safety of all road users.Proposals should address all the following aspects:Development of an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled digital twin of traffic and infrastructure. This would integrate historical, current, and forecast data, including crowdsourcing and infrastructure sensors, infrastructure topology and condition, along with environmental (e.g. local weather and visibility) and road and traffic conditions. Such a digital twin can allow monitoring and preventively optimising both safety and traffic flow, equally addressing congestion and resilience issues. Results from existing projects like OMICRON[1] could be considered. The proposals should also explore the possibility and usefulness of other type of data such as sociodemographic and economic data, behavioural driving data, data from security cameras, among others that could be provided by third parties (tourism, planned events, demand, etc.);Analyse in detail the technical challenges associated with the acquisition and use of adequate and reliable big data from multiple sensors in the road transport system, as well as the process of combining these datasets in ways that are meaningful for proactive road safety analysis;Develop methods and tools to predict safety-critical traffic situations at quantifiable risk levels based on real-time and historical data;Account for biases in the datasets and ensure that the developed AI-based models or algorithms are bias-free, so that the safety of all road users will be improved effectively in a fair, non-discriminatory way;Analyse in detail also the non-technical challenges associated with this approach and the inherent need to collect and share large amounts of data that can be used to identify and quantify road safety-related risk factors.

Scope:The overarching policy background is the European Grean Deal, which aims to achieve climate neutrality by 2050. In the transport area, this translates into a 90% reduction of transport-related greenhouse gas emissions by 2050[1]. To deliver the European Green Deal, there is a need to revise and upgrade numerous policies, including those for transport and large-scale infrastructures.The EU Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy[2] (SSMS), which translates this overall transport target into actions, states that infrastructure must be adapted to climate change and made resilient to disasters. In line with the SSMS, it is also important that such infrastructure should rely on clean and decarbonised energy sources, notably renewable energy, as well as on a modernised grid.Research in this topic should provide knowledge and technical solutions to a triple challenge: (1) limiting emissions of transport infrastructures; (2) making them more resilient to climate change; and (3) addressing environmental and biodiversity aspects. Projects should cover the entire life cycle of transport infrastructures, covering overall emissions from sourcing of materials, construction, maintenance, operation and decommissioning of the infrastructure.Proposals should address all of the following aspects:Development of new methods and techniques to construct, manage, maintain and repair (including self-repair) transport infrastructures, in order to increase climate resilience and lower emissions;Assessment of solutions considering the principles of circularity and taking into account the entire life cycle assessment (LCA) approach;Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) of the solutions considering the entire life cycle of the infrastructure and accompanying business plans for their implementation;Application of innovative materials (e.g. green asphalt, green cement, carbon sinks) that enable transport infrastructures to become more resilient, more sustainable and emit less pollutants;Validation of all the proposed solutions and proofs of concepts is to be carried out in at least two large-scale demonstrations. The demonstrations should cover at least two different transport infrastructure types (e.g., road, rail, waterborne, airport) which are located on at least two different Trans European Transport Network (TEN-T) corridors. The demonstrations should also cover different environments and phases of the infrastructure life cycle (e.g. design, construction, maintenance, decommissioning);Analysis of EU national and international standards in construction, inspection, maintenance and deconstruction, contributing to the decarbonisation and increased resilience of transport infrastructure;Design of green, sustainable and innovative public procurement methods, contributing to lowering the environmental footprint, resources, and material consumption;Demonstration of sustainable and climate resilient infrastructure with nature-based solutions (NBS[3]), minimising the negative effects on the environment, including the degradation of ecosystems, the fragmentation of habitats and the loss of biodiversity. The projects should develop clear indicators with baselines and quantified targets in support of the expected outcomes that are monitored for each demonstration site. With regards to the expected outcomes, projects should take into account expected technological developments and policy implementation (e.g. revised TEN-T regulation), multi-disciplinary adaptive capacity in line with the European Climate Risk Assessment[4] (EUCRA) and the Commission Communication on Managing Climate Risks[5], in particular cascading impacts across sectors.Proposals should consider and build on results from previous calls on resilient and sustainable infrastructure and standards,[6] and should incorporate relevant EU guidance on the development and management of European transport infrastructures. Proposals should also build on previous results from projects on advanced materials, sensor technology, digitalisation, asset management, decision support and automation in the construction and maintenance of infrastructures.

Scope:While the increased use of sustainable transport modes and multimodal solutions are critical levers for transport, logistics and supply chain decarbonisation, and despite obvious environmental advantages, the modal share of the EU IWT sector has remained below expectations over the last decades. The seamless integration of inland waterway transport in multimodal supply chains requires the physical and digital connection to other land transport modes and maritime transport. Digitalisation is not a goal in itself but an important supporting development required to remain competitive and to improve the connectivity to ports, other transport modes and the clients (e.g. to keep the direct costs low and to allow synchromodal solutions). Digital interconnectivity (with logistics systems and other digital platforms for transport) is crucial to increase the modal share of IWT in multimodal logistics chains and to be able to significantly contribute to the modal shift goals as presented in the Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy[3].Proposals are expected to focus on the integration of smart vessels, smart infrastructure, smart data and smart governance in multimodal logistics chains. The proposals should address all of the following aspects:Building on the results of previous and on-going Horizon 2020, Horizon Europe and Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) funded projects, identify, develop and test robust technical and operational solutions and tools (also exploring innovative technologies such as generative Artificial Intelligence) to connect physically and digitally IWT to existing land and waterborne multimodal logistics chains for a sustainable, efficient, safe, resilient, automated IWT with a view to synchromodal transport;Define and develop key parts of the IWT-related aspects of a common framework for multi-modal data sharing, while enabling compatibility with legacy systems; building upon the concepts and solutions developed in other Union initiatives aimed to facilitate data sharing in transport, such as the Digital Transport and Logistics Forum (DTLF), the European mobility data space (EMDS), the electronic Freight Transport Information regulation; and considering high value datasets, the revised Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) Directive[4] and River Information Services (RIS) Directive. Outside of the scope are any type of new platforms or similar; rather, proposals are expected to leverage existing frameworks or platforms to ensure effective use case implementation (e.g. proposed solutions could interface with and be integrated in existing platforms used by shippers, carriers and freight forwarders to connect with multimodal information). Proposals could also identify datasets already available or that could be developed in order to enhance the integration of IWT in multimodal supply chains;Define and test applications and use cases, building on the proposed solutions for advanced cooperative Smart Shipping and Smart Logistics, including integration with the physical infrastructure, in at least four demonstration pilots in actual operational environments (minimum at TRL 7). The pilots should focus on better integrating inland waterway transport in the multimodal supply chains, with a focus on cross border applications, on the accessibility and usability of node services in an automated/digital manner, and on efficient and green operations. The pilots should cover different types of goods, different routes and IWT basins (to have better EU geographical coverage), possibly along the Trans-European Transport Network corridors. To ensure a user and governance perspective approach, the pilot cases should be led by industry stakeholders (e.g. freight forwarders, intermodal operators), in cooperation with shippers and public administrations (involvement of public administrations is considered a priority). The impact of increased automation and digitalisation on all stakeholders should be considered"

Importantly, the consortium should aim to create a community that has a lasting impact beyond the duration of the project. To this extent, the funded projects, once awarded, shall establish contact with each other and seek active exchange.Heighten standards of information integrity, especially among the community of influencers: The involvement of influencers and young Europeans in a campaign raising awareness about risks related to information integrity and good practices to counter them is expected to raise related standards both within the community involved in content creation, and beyond.Positive social and well-being outcomes: Greater awareness of manipulative online content among young Europeans will also contribute to mitigate certain mental health pressures, curb polarisation and encourage socially responsible behaviour online, contributing to a more resilient European digital sphere.Sustainable knowledge-sharing: The project will leave a legacy by codifying successful content, formats, and dissemination methods through an evaluation system with relevant metrics. Objective:ObjectivesThe objective of this call is to foster the awareness and resilience of young Europeans related to information integrity risks, strengthening relevant media and digital literacy skills. This to equip them with the skills and knowledge to navigate safely and critically in the online information space and participate in society as active and informed citizens. This should be achieved by developing engaging, multilingual content tailored to the consumption patterns and interests of young Europeans. Ensuring a broad coverage of at least thirteen EU Member States is a key criterion for the proposal evaluation.Specific objectivesTo involve young Europeans and influencers in a participatory process to create engaging content on the risks threatening information integrity. The content should include ways to identify, understand and counter such threats while promoting critical thinking among young Europeans aged 15–30.To disseminate content across all at least thirteen EU Member States through a media literacy campaign that leverages creative storytelling by mobilising influencers, who will work in full editorial independence, supported by digital media and artificial intelligence.To foster new collaborations between information integrity professionals (e.g. fact-checkers, media literacy practitioners, civil society organisations) and influencers, so that they can join forces and learn from each other on ways to promote media literacy and critical thinking among young Europeans. Such collaborations should also aim to support the creation of a virtual community allowing influencers to easily connect with fact-checkers, media literacy practitioners and other information integrity professionals across Europe.To collect and share lessons learned on how influencers can integrate information integrity best practices in their work, including by raising the trustworthiness of their own content. This should involve an evaluation of the reach, impact and effectiveness of the conducted campaigns by the consortium partners. Scope:ScopeThe call seeks to fund two innovative projects that implement the following activities in all covered Member States.1. Design a participatory process involving young Europeans and influencersThe consortium will design and implement a participatory process to allow young Europeans to share their ideas, questions and concerns related to the online information space and information integrity, involving them in the creation and dissemination of engaging content to address information integrity and safety online. The objective is to ensure"

Scope:The objective of this new scheme is to tackle brain drain and precarity of researchers' careers to make Europe more attractive to the most promising young talents. Applicants submit proposals for talent recruitment programmes that will provide researchers holding a doctoral degree with excellent research and academic opportunities, potentially coupled with management activities, to lead them to concrete and attractive career prospects. This will have an impact on the enhancement of human resources in R&I at institutional, regional, national or international level. These programmes will be co-funded by MSCA Choose Europe for Science.The programmes will be divided into two phases. A first phase (24-36 months) in which the EU funding is equivalent to the minimum gross salary for the recruited researcher during this phase and a second phase (24 months) in which the applicant is expected to continue to employ the researcher, set salaries attractive at a national level and ensure availability of the necessary internal or external funds.Proposed programmes can cover any research disciplines. The selection procedure for candidates must be open, competitive, merit-based and with a transparent international peer-review in line with the European Charter for Researchers[1]. Alignment with the principles outlined in the Agreement on Reforming Research Assessment[2] is also encouraged. Selection criteria should be based primarily on excellence. Additional selection criteria require clear alignment with local human resources needs identified in the relevant institutional, regional or national strategies. These must be described in the proposal and must be listed in the vacancy notice (to be widely advertised internationally, including on the EURAXESS website[3]) alongside the gross salaries applicable to the two programme phases (net salary + employee’s taxes and contributions). Selected fellows will be able to work in research, teaching or management positions and, where relevant, define their own research topic at their host institution(s). The programmes should aim at offering excellent working conditions to researchers, including salary, professional resources, and career development.The career development should incorporate transversal skills but also job-specific skills and, where relevant, language courses to ensure that the training is in line with the career opportunities offered following the fellowship. These opportunities must include concrete and attractive long-term career prospects, such as pathways towards open-ended contracts, which can be subject to assessment and evaluation. There must be a fair, equal, inclusive, transparent, structured career accession and progression system providing access to these opportunities in line with the Council Recommendation of 18 December 2023 on a European framework to attract and retain research, innovation and entrepreneurial talents in Europe, the European Charter for Researchers in its annex and the Agreement on Reforming Research Assessment.A Career Development Plan must be maintained throughout the period of the Choose Europe for Science programme. In addition to research objectives, this Plan comprises the researcher's career development needs, including training on languages, transferable skills, teaching, planning for publications and participation in conferences and events. The Plan should outline the projected career progression paths in the host institution.[1] Council Recommendation of 18 December 2023 on a European framework to attract and retain research, innovation and entrepreneurial talents in Europe[2] agreement_final.pdf (coara.eu)[3] EURAXESS |Show more Topic descriptionExpected Outcome: For supported researchers:Concrete career prospects and increased career stabilityAccess to diverse career pathways in and outside academiaDeeper and more diverse set of research-related, academic and transferable skills and competences, leading to greater autonomy For participating organisations:Better alignment"

One of the attachments is a detailed project description with more details. My RCN web is the Research Council of Norway’s application system for research funding and is used for administrating the CRESCENDO call. The person submitting the application on behalf of the project partners needs to create a user in My RCN web.Please note that you can only submit the application once. If you submit the application before the deadline and subsequently see that it still needs to be changed, you can create a new application, e.g., as a copy of the one you have already submitted – and in this way submit a new version before the deadline expires. The application and all attachments must be written in English, and all attachments must be in PDF format. Be careful to upload the correct attachment type, as there are no technical restrictions on what kind of templates it is possible to upload in the application form.Mandatory attachmentsProject description. Use the standard template that you can download at the bottom of the page.CV for the project manager. Use the standard template that you can download at the bottom of the page.All required attachments should be included when submitting the application, otherwise the application will be rejected. Optional attachments CVs for key participants in the project. Use the standard template that you can download at the bottom of the page. We do not accept attachments submitted after the application deadline unless we have requested additional documentation. We will not consider documents and websites linked to in the application, or attachments other than those specified above. Application in My RCN web This CRESCENDO call deviates a bit from how the fields and text are in the web-based application form in My RCN web. As a result, here is a guide to how you should fill in the application in My RCN web. The numbered sections below correspond to each individual step that must be taken in the application form. The rest of the application will be submitted as a part of the mandatory attachments as mentioned above. Project partnersWhen adding organisations in My RCN web, non-Norwegian organisations may ignore the organisation search box and manually enter their organisation’s details. The institution’s name does not need to be in Norwegian.Do not add project partners in My RCN web, only add a project owner and other mandatory fields marked with *.

The projects must use objective and measurable (quantitative and qualitative) impact indicators for their proposed objectives and activities that will be assessed by an impact evaluation methodology. These indicators should include inter alia:the baseline (i.e. a description of the current levels of awareness and perception of the CAP amongst the targeted audience). This could be based on Special Eurobarometer 520 data or other objective and credible data sources that define the levels of awareness and perception about the CAP in a particular target audiencethe total number of contacts expected to be made during the communication and information activities, andthe targeted increase in the total number of contacts who recognise and/or have a more positive opinion of the CAP as a result of the information and communication activities (in relation to the baseline). Objective:The general objective of the call is to raise awareness about the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) within the EU, amongst all citizens, farmers and non-farmers alike and to disseminate information about the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), the key messaging should be fully consistent with the Commission's legal requirement to carry out information measures on the CAP within the meaning of Article 46 of Regulation (EU) 2021/2116.The measures should help citizens understand the CAP, about how the CAP responds to challenges faced by agriculture and food producers, helps restore consumer confidence following crises, supports development in rural areas and promotes a more competitive, sustainable and resilient Union model of agriculture, including its simplification agenda.The measures should help citizens understand the CAP through coherent, evidence-based, objective and comprehensive information. The measures should To inform citizens, farmers and consumers on about how the CAP and how the CAP, including the national CAP Strategic Plans, responds to challenges faced in agriculture and food production, encourages competitiveness of the agrifood sector, supports farmers’ income and their position in the food value chain.The measures should also help citizens understand how the CAP rewards farmers preserving biodiversity and natural ecosystems, including mitigating climate change, and promotes a more sustainable Union model of agriculture. Finally, the measures should also help the audience to understand how the CAP supports development in rural areas.The proposals submitted should focus on the ten specific objectives of the CAP, taking into account the Member States' CAP strategic plans, the Action Plan for the Development of Organic Production, the Common Market Organisation, the Unfair Trade Practices Directive and the Political Orientations for the next European Commission 2024-2029. They should provide coherent, objective, evidence-based and comprehensive information measures, reaching a significant number of citizens in the EU, in order to help explain, implement and develop the CAP and to raise public awareness of its content and objectives, including its contribution to guaranteeing a stable supply of affordable food, to supporting farmer’s income, and to ensuring long-term competitiveness, resilience and sustainability of EU’s farming sector.The motivation of proposals submitted should also consider addressing lack of information about European"

Grants will be provided to support the swift implementation.Objective:In spring 2024, the Regulation establishing the European Digital Identity Framework has been adopted, introducing a step change in the cross-border application of Digital Identity ushered in by the introduction of the EU Digital Identity Wallet in all Member States by the end of 2026. Over the period 2025-2027, the priority is to complete the transition from the current organizational and technical infrastructure to the new European Digital Identity Framework. The Commission will facilitate the new EU Digital Identity Wallet architecture and its European Trust Infrastructure, as well as promote its adoption by eco-system participants in all the Member States as well as in new domains, with a focus on business applications. This will help implement the Digital Decade goal of providing 100% of European citizens with access to digital identification. The work will build on the existing technical specifications and reference implementation, and the results of the first round of Large Scale Pilots and aim to maintain the success of the eDelivery, eSignature and eID Building Blocks which have been taken up by Public Administrations (notably flagship applications of the Commission like the Import Control System, Business Registers Interconnection System, e-Justice, EU Sign, and the Once Only Technical System (OOTS)), helping provide 100% of key public services online (another Digital Decade goal) and the Private Sector (notably providers of electronic signatures) - both as Standards and through re-use of the reference implementations. In addition, the action should contribute to other relevant policy initiatives at EU level. Supported digital service infrastructures to facilitate European cross-border digital transactions include: European Digital Identity and Trust Services Ecosystem Gateways: These trust infrastructures allow companies, citizens, and administrations to validate European qualified trust service providers as well as the participants of the EU Digital Identity Wallet Ecosystem and support the governance of the regulatory system. eID Component: Ensuring legal, organizational, semantic, and technical interoperability for secure digital operations that require cross-border identity recognition. EU Digital Identity Wallet: Services and infrastructure for storing and sharing identity data for natural or legal persons as well as other electronic attestation of attributes, with a focus on business applications, including the infrastructure for certification of wallets. eDelivery: A standards-based solution for safe and cryptographically secured data exchange over the internet, which ensures secure data and documents exchange (C2C, B2C, B2B). eSignature: standards-based approach for secure communication of intent in digital transactions, with the electronic signature library being reused by multiple European trust services. These infrastructures will be defined, developed, adjusted, and maintained in collaboration with Member States. Their purpose is to enhance digital solutions across various policy domains, promote “interoperability by design,” and ensure accessibility for individuals with disabilities and older persons. The action aims to: Facilitate effective implementation of the European Digital Identity Regulation. Provision by Member States of a harmonized EU Digital Identity Wallet by the end of 2026, delivering on their legal obligation under the European Digital Identity Regulation and on the Digital Decade Target. Rapid adoption of the EU Digital Identity Wallet by citizens, public institutions and businesses.

Objective:The primary objective is to establish a comprehensive technical and financial roadmap that demonstrates the potential of the quantum computer developed by the start-up for scientific innovation, economic relevance, and eventual industrial-scale deployment. In addition to the roadmap, eligible companies should deliver physical proofs of principle or preliminary prototypes that demonstrate the feasibility of their integrated hardware and software quantum computing systems. These outputs will be subject to technical assessment and a financial pre-screening, and pending a positive outcome, they will form the basis for consideration in Phase 2. The projects should showcase the added value of their quantum computing solutions in one or more carefully chosen application sectors, selected by the start-up based on technical feasibility and projected market return. As of Phase 2, the start-up should be accompanied by a number of users representative of the selected application sectors. Applicants are encouraged to include in their proposal Expressions of Interest from those user representatives.Scope:Proposals should develop an integrated technical and financial roadmap together with a benchmarking strategy. The roadmap should outline how the targeted quantum computer, combining hardware and software components, may be developed in Phase 2, ensuring a fully integrated solution.Projects should develop detailed financial viability assessments, identifying potential revenue models, commercialization pathways, and criteria for unlocking private investment during subsequent phases. Participants will receive, as appropriate to their project’s needs, tailored advisory services from the EIB Advisory, including technical and financial planning during the execution of their project in Phase 1.To ensure that Phase 1 delivers tangible outputs beyond planning documents, projects are expected to demonstrate prototypes or proofs of principle that showcase the technical feasibility of the proposed quantum computing solution in representative use cases. Standalone software-only or hardware-only approaches will not be considered. The proposal should specify appropriate performance metrics (e.g., number of physical qubits, quantum volume, gate- and readout fidelities, scalability targets, implementation of logical qubits), potential error mitigation methods and respective milestones, and the proposed methodology for validating these metrics in experimental setups at the indicated milestone date.Proposals should identify industry-relevant use cases or societal challenges that aim to address high-impact applications. Metrics such as potential computational advantages over classical computing approaches in specific tasks, improved energy efficiency, or unique problem-solving capabilities should be highlighted to support the added value in real-world adoption in the sense of quantum utility[1], without necessarily requiring claims of quantum supremacy. While references to quantum advantage metrics are encouraged where relevant, they are not mandatory at this stage. Applicants are encouraged to adopt standardized benchmarking methods (inspired by global best practices) that measure key performance indicators such as quantum volume, gate fidelity, and qubit coherence times.Proposals should include clear descriptions of how benchmarking and performance metrics will be integrated into project activities and demonstrate their relevance to both technological milestones and commercial objectives.At the end of Phase 1, the retained projects will be evaluated for potential eligibility to continue into Phase 2. The evaluation will consider the quality of technical progress, benchmarking results, feasibility and impact of the integrated hardware-software prototypes, and financial viability in alignment with investor expectations. Priority will be given to entities integrating their solutions into existing EU supercomputing centres (HPCs) to facilitate testing and deployment in high-performance computing environments. Up to 7 startups from Phase 1 will be retained for Phase 2.Financial Pre-screening: At the end of Phase 1 the Financial Pre-screening will assess the following items:Satisfactory indications of financial and commercial standing of the entity (including pre-appraisal of business description,"

To that end, proposals under this topic should aim to deliver results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to some or all of the following expected outcomes:Foster the development and prepare for the commercialisation of innovative space-based solutions that supports an informed decision making of relevant stakeholders (e.g. energy operators, city and regional authorities, financial institutions, insurance companies, corporations, food/industrial manufacturing etc.);Leverage EGNSS-based and Copernicus-based capabilities to modernize and increase the efficiency and resilience of energy infrastructure and/or urban environment, and/or support the use of green financing schemes addressing environmental challenges as well as implementing climate resilient practices in the downstream sector;Analyse and support the consolidation of the sectorial demand for solutions based on EGNSS and Copernicus services and data, possibly also exploring the synergies with EU space based secure communication and surveillance, addressing the challenges identified in priority areas and leveraging the relevant regulatory environment. Scope:Europe has made a considerable investment in its space infrastructure, resulting in two pivotal outcomes: first, a strategic autonomy of the continent, and second, a surge in economic growth driven by space-enabled applications. Additionally, Europe boasts a thriving sector offering space data, services and products, which continues to show steady growth.The market for space data and services is fragmented, both on the side of supply and demand. A fragmented and underdeveloped demand from both public and private users does not allow for scaling up, hindering the realization of the full potential of the EU Space infrastructure.Space data can be used in almost all industry verticals in the EU and worldwide. While some sectors are already using space data to high extent, providing benefits to the citizens, economy and environment, other sectors are only marginally testing the ground. The demand creation is progressing, however, in order to foster the space data economy, it is needed to scale up and accelerate the market uptake and mass adoption of space data, in the context of the applicable legal framework.In order to achieve this, the proposals should focus on the development of innovative solutions, tailored to the specific needs of downstream industries and verticals and addressing inherent sectorial demand fragmentation issues. There is also an untapped potential of using space data to bolster green and digital transitions, presenting an opportunity to create innovative solutions in these domains.Moreover, the projects should leverage the existing relevant sectorial regulations and policies, by exploring how the proposed solutions using space data and services can support these regulations.Projects supporting the integration of EU Space data and services into vertical market segments should focus on one of the following selected priority areas (and identify which area is being addressed in the proposal):Energy (renewable energy, energy efficiency, energy infrastructure) In the face of energy supply shortages and climate change, the demand for renewable energy is rapidly increasing. Driving this demand is the fact that renewables are reducing greenhouse gas emissions and transitioning the world towards a sustainable future. Moreover, energy efficiency initiatives aim to optimize energy consumption across various sectors, from manufacturing to residential spaces, fostering a more sustainable and responsible approach to energy use. To expedite this transition, space data and services enable energy stakeholders to make informed decisions about the deployment and management of renewable energy infrastructure and to gain insights into energy consumption patterns across diverse sectors and geographic regions. Examples of downstream innovation in this context is the use of GNSS and EO technologies to enhance energy infrastructure resilience and efficiency in smart grids by adapting to real-time demand changes or to facilitate the monitoring and management of electricity distribution networks.Climate adaptation and Environmental footprint reduction: The implementation of effective Climate adaptation measures can foster climate resilience and reduce vulnerability to climate change, in communities, ecosystems and infrastructure. GNSS and EO technologies provide accurate and up to date data for assessing climate risks, prioritizing adaptation measures and allocate resources effectively to reduce environmental footprint, enabling a deeper understanding of climate change impacts and informing effective mitigation strategies.

Yet, they are facing multiple challenges. Partially as a result of the digital shift, with readers shifting to online sources and traditional news outlets losing advertising revenues, the economic sustainability of professional journalism has come under pressure. Many media at the local level as well as those putting their public interest mission before profits, have had to close down, weakening media pluralism and posing risks for the good functioning of democracy.Topic 2. “Journalism Partnerships - Pluralism” covers media sectors that are particularly relevant for democracy. Certain sectors having an important role for democratic debate lack the means to adapt to the digital environment, and phenomena such as shrinking newsrooms or media deserts can lead to a deterioration of pluralism. Support is thus needed for them to improve their position, adapt their methods, continue providing a first-hand source of original reporting to citizens, help keep decision-makers accountable and ultimately contribute to a more diverse and independent sector.Priorities Proposals must put in place funding schemes for news media entities and independent journalism and dedicate at least 60% of the total amount of the grant to it. Accompanying activities may be proposed. Applicant organisations should be in a position to set up funding schemes (support to third parties) targeting news media outlets, organisations and, if needed, professionals, such as local and regional media, community media, investigative journalism and organisations delivering public interest news, and in ways that enhance pluralistic media landscapes across the European Union. Non-profit and civil society organisations are particularly encouraged to apply.The proposed activities must focus on news media sectors of special relevance to democracy and civic participation, i.e. the role they play in enhancing democracy, shaping the public debate and bringing benefits to their audiences and communities, instead of focusing just on profit. For the purpose of this call, these sectors are in particular:Local and regional mediaIndependent and investigative journalismOrganisations delivering public interest news/public service journalism (such as community, legal and civic journalism and media, news increasing transparency about the media) Activities Applicants must present, develop and implement a funding scheme for cascading grants (i.e. regranting / support to third parties) for independent media and organisations primarily active in one or more of these sectors. They will cover as many geographical areas and news media organisations as possible.They shall focus on activities that contribute to sustaining, improving or transforming the work of the targeted parties. Activities can among others consist of:Innovations in editorial production (e.g. formats, content), coverage and revenue modelsThe improvement of distribution and dissemination of newsThe development and engagement of audiences and community-building strategiesThe development of technical tools applying to the above topicsTraining on the above topics Putting in place a funding scheme is compulsory. The funding should be accompanied by active communication towards a maximum of potential stakeholders across the geographical areas covered by the proposal. It is possible to complement the funding scheme with accompanying activities, if relevant and based on a needs analysis of the chosen subsector/s. Such accompanying activities may include, e.g., the development of deontological and governance standards, budgetary readiness, development of criteria and indicators framing their support, repositories of knowledge, legal advice or trainings. The proposal must explain how the proposed activities will work towards addressing the identified challenges.Proposals should focus on the European Union, and specifically areas with low provision of the specific news described above or in media markets where media pluralism is strained. The needs of smaller newsrooms may also be addressed.Activities must include concrete deliverables and set clear, objectively verifiable and quantifiable performance indicators for the mid-term and the end of the project. The estimated impact must be more precise than the sum of available distribution channels, and should be substantiated by a detailed outreach plan as well as proof of interest from the target groups.All projects need to respect widely accepted professional media standards.

Yet, they are facing multiple challenges. Partially as a result of the digital shift, with readers shifting to online sources and traditional news outlets losing advertising revenues, the economic sustainability of professional journalism has come under pressure. Many media at the local level as well as those putting their public interest mission before profits, have had to close down, weakening media pluralism and posing risks for the good functioning of democracy.Topic 1. “Journalism Partnerships - Collaborations” seeks to help the wider European news media sector become more sustainable and resilient, including small media. Support is foreseen for collaborative projects in and between any news media (sub)sector and/or genre that aim to enhance cooperation, help media adapt to new economic and consumption realities and instil systemic change across that (sub)sector.PrioritiesProjects must focus on ways to develop collaborative transformation, from a business, technological and/or production point of view.Projects can aim to develop, inter alia, better revenue and monetisation models, new approaches to audience development, community-building and marketing, development of common professional/technical standards, new types of newsrooms, syndication networks or other models to exchange content/data between news media across the EU, or provide assistance to small media organisations. They can aim to increase efficiency and the quality of reporting through innovative journalistic collaborations. Projects can test innovative production methods and formats, or contribute to high-quality media production standards in other collaborative ways. Projects can aim to increase exchanges of best practices among journalists and optimise workflows for those journalism genres requiring more time and resources.Proposals may address one or more of the priorities outlined above, if relevant and based on the needs analysis of the chosen (sub)sector. The proposal should provide this needs analysis and explain how the proposed activities will work towards addressing the identified challengesActivitiesActivities can include events, online trainings and workshops for media professionals, exchange programmes, mentoring schemes, mapping of best practices, sector-wide development of technical standards, development of guidelines and editorial standards, production of practical guidebooks, development and testing of platforms and technical solutions to exchange ideas and best practices, promotional activities, or other activities that aim to uphold the viability of the sector. Sharing of best practices between operators in media markets/countries/regions with different and diverse characteristics (in terms of languages, production volumes, sizes, digitalisation levels etc.) is encouraged, to promote mutual learning. Applicants are encouraged to consider activities supporting media sectors lacking the means of adapting to the digital environment.Financial support to third parties will be accepted in projects which foresee exchange programmes for journalists and other media professionals, support to attend trainings or events, support to journalists and media outlets for collaborative journalistic projects, support for legal advice, support for the acquisition, development or maintenance of technical tools for collaborative journalism, support for events in these fields and/or prizes for collaboration or innovation. In such cases, applicants must define the terms under which this financial support to third parties would take place and ensure a fair and transparent process.In all cases, the choice of activities should be based on their potential to instil systemic change in the chosen subsector.Projects must include concrete deliverables and set clear, objectively verifiable and quantifiable performance indicators for the mid-term and the end of the project. The estimated impact must be more precise than the sum of available distribution channels, and should be substantiated by a detailed outreach plan as well as proof of interest from the target groups.All projects need to respect widely accepted professional media standards. The chosen standards and the relevant mechanisms to ensure them should be indicated in the proposal and confirmed with a signed Declaration on Standards & Independence (Annexed to the Application form). Partnerships involving editorial work must operate with full editorial independence.All Partnerships should consider the ecological footprint of the activities they propose, and where relevant, describe the strategies to ensure a more sustainable and environmentally-respectful media sectors.Show more Topic descriptionScope:The European news media sectors play a crucial and valuable role in Europe.

Applicants are kindly asked to read and follow the instructions provided within this template carefully.The structure of the Proposal Submission Template must be followed when preparing your proposal. It has been designed to ensure that the important aspects of your planned work are presented in a way that will enable the evaluators to make an effective assessment against the evaluation criteria.Please be aware that proposals will be evaluated as they are submitted, rather than on their potential if certain changes need to be made. This means that only proposals that successfully address all the requests will have a chance of being evaluated. There will be no possibility for significant changes to content, budget and team composition during grant preparation.The page limit for the technical part is 6 pages. All tables, figures and references must be included as an integral part of the document and are thus counted against this page limit. Excess pages (in overlong proposals) will not be taken into consideration by the evaluators.Evaluators will be instructed to ignore hyperlinks to information that is specifically designed to expand the proposal, thus circumventing the page limit. Only references and links that point to the mandatory proof of maturity of the solution will be accepted. The following formatting conditions apply: the reference font for the body text is Calibri. The use of a different font for the body text is not advised and is subject to the cumulative conditions that the font is legible and that its use does not significantly shorten the representation of the proposal in the number of pages compared to using the reference font (for example, with a view to bypassing the page limit). The minimum font size allowed is 11 points. Standard character spacing and a minimum of single line spacing must be used. Text elements other than the body text, such as headers, foot/end notes, captions, formulas, may deviate, but must be legible. The page size is A4, and all margins (top, bottom, left, right) should be at least 15 mm. For keeping the formatting of the document, the use of Microsoft Word or Word Online is recommended. English is the official language for this Open Call. The Open Call Evaluation Board will review each proposal, scoring them based on a set of questions that will be prepared and will be related to: Alignment: Applicants must align with each call’s objectives and challenges as well as the HE specific call (HORIZON-CL3-2022-CS-01-01). Excellence: The application must demonstrate a clear set of objectives aligned with the definition of the goals and with the general objectives of the project. Impact: Applicants must define their ambition, and a clear set of expectations aligned with the objectives of the Call. Proposals must demonstrate the project’s impact.

To that end, the participating authorities shall set procedural arrangements on cooperation and information sharing.Furthermore, regional cable hubs could also benefit from additional solutions for the surveillance and protection of submarine cables, and the detection of malicious activities. For instance, situational awareness performed through the collection and analysis of in-situ, sea-based sensor data as well as relevant satellite imagery or undersea drones capacities.The Hubs could make use of existing systems which were not developed necessarily for Cable Security, such as the Integrated Maritime Systems, the Common Information Sharing Environment (CISE), the EU Copernicus Space Programme, and the Maritime Surveillance System. (MARSUR).The Hubs should also integrate direct cooperation with private entities, especially cable operators to increase access – in a highly secured framework - to information on ongoing and future threats and voluntary incident reporting.The Hubs should progressively also integrate the defence dimension, as any defence capacities is likely to increase the situational awareness as well as the capacity to respond fast in case of incident against these strategic critical infrastructures. To that end, Member States can integrate in the operations of the Hubs their defence capacities (e.g. navy or surveillance system) and operational command while building on international partnerships.To support the above activities of a Regional Cable Hub, a grant will be available to cover, among others, the preparatory activities for setting up the Regional Cable Hub, its interaction and cooperation between its members and with other stakeholders, as well as the running/operating costs involved, enabling the effective operation of the Regional Cable Hub. The grant could also be used to cover the acquisition of the infrastructures, tools and services needed to build-up the Regional Cable Hub but also to equip it with the necessary capacities to enhance the security and resilience of undersea cables, such as detection capacities.These actions aim at creating or strengthening Regional Cable Hubs, which occupy a central role in ensuring the Security and resilience of strategic and critical infrastructures, providers of essential services such as global connectivity and power supply. As previously noted, Regional Cable Hubs will have a crucial operative role in ensuring the security of undersea cables in the Union and will handle sensitive information.Pursuant to Article 12 of Regulation (EU) 2021/694, participation to the calls funded under this topic will be therefore subject to the restrictions of Article 12(5), as specified in Appendix 3 of this Work Programme.Objective:As part of the EU Action Plan on Cable Security, it was announced that the Commission, together with voluntary Member States, will work on Cable Integrated Surveillance Mechanisms per sea basin (‘Regional Cable Hubs’) to enhance the detection capacity against threats to undersea cables as they are critical infrastructure.Taking into account the fact that these cables are covered by the scope of NIS2 Directive that follows an all-hazards approach, it is crucial to protect their physical environment from events such as malicious acts, including cuts as integral part of the cable cybersecurity measures.The objective is to support the progressive establishment of Regional Cable hubs, one per sea basins of the EU, whose role will be to concretely enhance threats detection and operational security around these strategic infrastructures.This action is therefore aimed at supporting the set-up of processes, tools and services for detection and analysis of emerging threats, to establish a near real time situational awareness to protect the undersea cables. It includes the capacity to aggregate data and security information from all available sources (including established systems such as the Integrated Maritime System, or CISE, or National Cyber Hubs) and analyse them in an"

Promote the mitigation of risks associated with the misuse of AI by malicious actors, with a focus on AI ethics and secure deployment.Contribution to the standardisation and certification of cybersecure, trustworthy AI technologies. Objective:This topic addresses AI-based technologies (including GenAI) for national authorities and competent authorities, including National and Cross-Border Cyber Hubs, CSIRTs, public bodies and private entities from the NIS 2 directive, NCCs1, etc. They play a key role in providing central operational capacity to European cybersecurity ecosystems. They may also provide primary input data for AI/ML-based cybersecurity tools and solutions, which can strengthen such authorities’ capacity to analyse, detect and prevent cyber threats and incidents, and to support the production of high-quality intelligence on cyber threats. In particular, the adoption of generative AI2 could be a challenge and an opportunity for cybersecurity3 processes and applications.These enabling technologies should allow for more effective creation and analysis of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI), automation of large-scale processes, as well as faster and scalable processing of CTI and identification of patterns that allow for rapid detection and decision making.The security of AI itself, especially for the systems in the learning phase, also needs to be addressed, including the misuse of AI by malicious actors. This includes carrying out risk assessments and mitigation of cybersecurity risks inherent to AI technologies, implementing supply chain security, etc., and complying with the AI Act, intellectual property legislation and the GDPR.In addition to being secure, the AI technologies being developed should perform well, and be robust and trustworthy. In particular, having trustworthy AI solutions will help in the deployment phase, where social acceptance is essential.1If applicable and in line with individual national strategies.2Cybersecurity in the age of generative AI, September 2023, available at: https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/themes/cybersecurity-in-the-age-of-generative-ai.3The Need For AI-Powered Cybersecurity to Tackle AI-Driven Cyberattacks, April 2024, available at: https://www.isaca.org/resources/news-and-trends/isaca-now-blog/2024/the-need-for-ai-powered-cybersecurity-to-tackle-ai-driven-cyberattacks.Scope:Actions in this topic should develop and deploy systems and tools for cybersecurity1, based on AI technologies2, addressing aspects such as threat detection, vulnerability detection, threat mitigation, incident recovery through self-healing, data analysis and data sharing.

This Group established in 2024 a dedicated FRMCS Deployment Subgroup to focus specifically on FRMCS future deployment activities, drawing upon insights and results from the sector plans, activities as well as EU-Rail test and demonstration initiatives.The current railway telecommunications system, GSM-R, is based on 3GPP 2G technology and is rapidly becoming obsolete. Railway telecommunications manufacturers have indicated that GSM-R networks, components, and technical support will begin to phase out from 2030 onwards. The CCS TSI 2023 sets a specific implementation rule that there is a minimum notification period of 5 years to turn off GSM-R on a specific track. In recent years, the railway sector has been actively engaged in the development of a new telecommunications system. This new system is mission-critical to ensuring the safe operation of railways. While it will continue to support current functionalities such as voice and data transmission, it will also introduce new capabilities essential for future applications. .Following the (still ongoing) development of functional and system requirements, EU-RAIL launched a test and demonstrator programme through the EU-RAIL Flagship Project FP2- MORANE2 (GA number: 101196125), which is dedicated to the execution of both lab and field testing to validate the FRMCS specifications.EU-RAIL System Pillar, will produce an updated report, with commitment of the whole Railway sector, including scope of the FRMCS specifications that will be integrated in TSI and used by the sector to procure/develop the related solutions.The EU-RAIL FRMCS deployment subgroup is tasked with addressing broader issues related to FRMCS future deployment and implementation. The urgency stems from the railway sector's view that the future availability of telecommunications presents a high-risk challenge. As a result, the sector strongly prioritizes the timely introduction of new 5G-based technology. This should be achieved within the shortest possible timeframe for upgrading existing equipment, while adhering to a European-level synchronisation strategy, taking into account both operational limitations and the individual starting positions of each Member StateThe coordination and supporting action of the project stemming from this topic shall :Provide support for the activities of the European FRMCS Deployment Group, ensuring well-organised planning, effective execution, and continuous monitoring of all actions related to deployment.More specifically, support the EU-RAIL FRMCS deployment subgroup on the : Analysis of (current) Infrastructure, rolling stock, industry and workshop capacity for (fast, easy and cost effective) deployment.

Objective:The Commission has set ambitious targets in the Digital Decade Policy Programme of reaching 20 million ICT professionals employed in Europe, while promoting access of women to this field, by 2030. Effective collaboration among stakeholders in advanced digital skills is crucial for this investment to bear fruit and to reach the Digital Decade target. An umbrella action at European level, the European League of Advanced Digital Skills Academies, will spearhead this effort by federating existing sectoral initiatives (e.g. the Cybersecurity Skills Academy and the EuroHPC Virtual Training Academy), the newly created sectoral digital skills academies (see topic 4.1 of the DEP Work Programme 2025-2027) and other EU-funded projects focusing on advanced digital skills (notably the DIGITAL-funded higher (specialised) education programmes), fostering synergies with related initiatives like the Digital Largescale Partnership under the New Pact for Skills and the European Digital Education Hub. It will leverage platforms such as the Digital Skills and Jobs Platform to create a cohesive ecosystem. ELEVATE’s vision is to empower stakeholders through coordination, capacity building, communication, and market analysis, driving collective achievement in advanced digital skills.A special emphasis of the League will be on the development and piloting of a mechanism to provide a seal of quality/accreditation of excellence for training modules offered by existing or upcoming sectoral academies and initiatives.Scope:Initiatives such as the Cybersecurity Skills Academy and the four academies (see topic 4.1 of the DEP work Programme 2025-2027) tackle the shortage of ICT specialists in a specific area, highlighting critical issues. The League aims to enhance coordination and collaboration among sectoral initiatives and projects, fostering synergies and a collective approach to minimize fragmentation risks.The European League of Advanced Digital Skills Academies will be structured around four pillars: Coordination and collaboration among sectoral academies, sectoral initiatives and individual projects in advanced digital skills aimed at pooling resources and expertise. Using the Digital Skills and Jobs Platform, this effort will lead to (a) improved sharing of information and best practices, facilitating mutual learning and staying updated of developments, (b) enhanced stakeholder collaboration, including seeking partnerships and advocating for policy changes, (c) unified advocacy for systemic improvements, such as the provision of European joint degrees and micro-credentials in advanced digital skills and (d) strengthened networking and community building, fostering a sense of shared identity among initiatives.Capacity building activities will complement the training offer of the sectoral academies and sectoral initiatives, for example through implementing cross-sectoral mentoring programmes. Furthermore, the League will help developing a framework for a certification mechanism of modular learning credentials for advanced digital skills and support the sectoral academies/initiatives in implementing it. The certification of other existing trainings at European level through the League will be explored, closely with Member States, in line with the 2022 Council Recommendation on a European approach to micro-credentials1. The League is expected to leverage the Digital Skills and Jobs Platform to offer access to diverse learning materials and courses from various training institutions as well as the"

Objective:Aligned with the previous WP, this action aims to support the continued uptake and further expansion of the data space for manufacturing. The primary objective is to develop legal, technical and business solutions to pool sufficient data and enable authorized AI developers to have direct or indirect data access to train generative AI models specifically for the manufacturing sector. This initiative seeks to reinforce the role of the data space for manufacturing as a major productivity enhancement and collaboration mechanism within the EU.Scope:This initiative will support up to three data-collection projects, with around EUR 3 million co-funding from Digital Europe each, focused on manufacturing use cases to unlock advanced AI models, for example, predictive maintenance, process automation, supply chain management, product design and development and sustainability in production, and increase productivity in industrial environments such as purchases, logistics, resource planning and production halls. These projects aim to collect massive, high-quality data from real industrial environments, ensuring proper labelling where relevant, that could be used to train or finetune generative AI models for the manufacturing sector. The data collection has to be relevant for developing AI applications that can significantly benefit major EU manufacturing sectors (such as automotive, chemical, aeronautics and energy-intensive industries). The project proposal has to clearly identify the target sectors, the stakeholders, and have preliminary agreements about the intended data exchange.The data-collection projects will develop both technical and business solutions to enable authorized AI developers to have direct or indirect data access and utilize these large datasets while fully respecting the data holders' control over their data.Each data-collection project should propose clear use cases to ensure alignment with real-world needs and challenges. Ideally, the AI developers interested in using such data should be already identified in the proposal.The proposal will also ensure technical and legal solutions to make the generated datasets available to users of AI Factories. This will also enable AI Factories to leverage these datasets for the development of AI applications. To this extent, the inclusion of AI Factories in the project will be considered an advantage.Consortia are encouraged to use data intermediaries, as outlined in Chapter III of the Data Governance Act, or other appropriate mechanisms to manage the secure access to and processing of these datasets.The initiative must also work in close partnership with the Data Spaces Support Centre to ensure alignment and interoperability with the broader ecosystem of data spaces implemented with the support of the Digital Europe Programme. Additionally, the action must coordinate with AI Factories to ensure that the datasets generated can be effectively used in conjunction with data already available facilitating in this way collaborative approaches for the development of advanced AI models.Considering financial sustainability from the outset is crucial in the development of Common European Data Spaces to ensure their long-term viability and effectiveness. By establishing a sound financial model, developers can secure the resources necessary to adapt to evolving technological landscapes and user needs, ensuring that data spaces remain robust and beneficial over time.Show more Topic descriptionExpected Outcome:Deliverables The awarded proposals are expected to deliver: Solutions that allow the collection of large, high-quality data from real industrial environments, from different manufacturing systems/sectors.Solutions that allow access to these large datasets to train Generative AI models that respond to real-world industrial needs and challenges, preferably relying on trusted third parties hosting data and training compute on behalf of authorized AI developers.Agreements with specific AI factories providing information on the data sets available and the conditions for using them for training AI models.Interoperability and governance framework of manufacturing data spaces including from national industrial data spaces to ensure that mechanisms to aggregate data for training AI could be taken"

This contribution will be supported through concrete tools such as starter kits, a repository of replicability assessments as well as tailored guidance, documentation and outreach.Targeted support to national procurement processes, where relevant, possibly by a helpdesk. Pooling of demand for European GenAI solutions by public administrations in the form of among others technical benchmarks.Bringing together public administration and start-ups based on common needs and capabilities as defined in technical benchmarks etc. To complement the outreach strategy of the pilot projects, support to outreach and awareness-raising activities by public administrations, including communication materials.Strengthened integration of public administrations into the broader European AI ecosystem, through synergies with the AI-on-Demand Platform, EDIHs, the AI Factories and other relevant initiatives as well as ensured synergies with Commission-led initiatives that support AI adoption in public sector. Objective:Broadly speaking, the objective of this action is to coordinate and support the pilot projects delivering Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) solutions fully integrated into the operational workflows and IT systems of participating public administrations.First, this action should prioritise to enhance the scalability and replication of successful GenAI pilot solutions. This includes the projects' capabilities to be duplicated by other public administrations and to adjust efficiently to a growing number of users, public administrations, or application areas.Second, it will identify common needs from public administrations for GenAI solutions “Made in Europe”, facilitating the pooling of demand at EU level for European start-ups.As a result of these efforts, the action will deepen collaboration among public administrations across Member States, laying the foundation of a sustainable GenAI community. Through the dissemination of knowledge, tools, and mutual learning experiences, this community will help accelerate adoption and reinforce trust in European GenAI solutions.Scope:The selected consortium will be responsible for enhancing the scalability and replication of successful European GenAI pilot solutions, through activities that foster knowledge sharing, community building, and capacity development. Such activities could consist, for example, in implementing software documentation best practices, facilitating peer-to-peer knowledge sharing and experience exchange, deploying targeted training and support programs, and establishing a community of practice. A helpdesk can be set up to support pilot projects and other interested public administrations on technical, organisational and legal – such as procurement – matters. Importantly, the CSA will seek to identify common needs with the overarching goal of pooling demand from public administrations for GenAI solutions “Made in Europe”. Towards that end, the CSA will define benchmarks and minimum requirements at the technical level. It will work closely with and contribute to the innovation procurement hubs initiative[1], in particular to public procurement of innovation (PPI) and pre-commercial public procurement work strands. Furthermore, the CSA will raise awareness among European start-ups for its demand-pooling exercise through outreach activities targeted to start-up communities in Europe, conducting where relevant matchmaking exercises between public administrations and European start-ups.The CSA will play an important role in ensuring the pilot projects have a European dimension. This will be done by supporting the pilot projects with scalability and replicability. They will complement their planned actions with additional measures to maximise the reach and impact. Moreover, the European dimension will also be ensured by reporting on the pilot project’s activities, aggregating their KPIs and relevant figures to provide an overview on the use of GenAI by public administrations in Europe.Show more Topic descriptionExpected Outcome:Contribution to the replication and scalability of piloted GenAI solutions across public administrations and Member States, demonstrated through the ability to adapt them to new users, administrative levels or service areas.

Objective:This action aims to enhance the European genomic data infrastructure by supporting the deployment of advanced tools for data curation and use and its alignment with the European Health Data Space (EHDS). Data quality and volume are key success factors for health data infrastructures supported under the Digital Europe Programme, such as the one developed by the Genomic Data Infrastructure (GDI) project implementing the 1+ Million Genomes (1+MG) initiative of the Member States. The availability of thoroughly curated genomic data and related clinical and phenotypic information is a prerequisite for accelerating the move to the next level of multi-modal data modelling and deployment as well as health sector innovation in Europe. 1+MG and the projects implementing the initiative have worked and agreed on common data standards and ontologies, data quality criteria and thresholds, data inclusion policies and the necessary standard operational procedures. On that basis, data holders will need to quality-check and curate the datasets that they will be making available to 1+MG and EHDS (HealthData@EU) to ensure their interoperability and high value for users. Wide accessibility of the data and user-friendliness of the tools and services facilitating the access to data are critical success factors of the 1+MG data infrastructure. While such functionalities for research purposes have been already largely covered in the deployment project GDI, application in other use scenarios, in particular healthcare and public health policy, requires additional tools, application programming interfaces (APIs) and interfaces to address the corresponding specific user needs and requirements. The citizen perspective must be also factored in to ensure, through appropriate IT tools, full compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) rules regarding citizens’ rights on personal data protection. This action relates to the potential creation of a European Digital Infrastructure Consortium for genomic data (Genome EDIC) and supports the activities related to operating the 1+MG data infrastructure established with the support of Digital Europe under Work Programme 2021-2022 (GDI project), including its alignment with the requirements, technical specifications, and processes established by the EHDS Regulation to ensure a smooth functioning within the HealthData@EU infrastructure.Scope:Data tools for the 1+MG data infrastructure should be based on common standards and as automated as possible, and should enable data quality check at source, benchmarking, annotation and enhancement on the data provider end and by the operator of the data infrastructure, as appropriate. This covers the whole process of data inclusion, integration and access provision, as well as compliance assessment, risk management and data security assurance on the side of data infrastructure. All steps and functionalities should be designed to support the needs and requirements of three main use scenarios, i.e. research (largely already covered by the GDI project), and clinical care and public health policymaking. They should follow and implement the standards and procedures agreed within the 1+ Million Genomes initiative (1+MG Framework) and be compliant with the EHDS Regulation. For example, data curation tools should facilitate the description of datasets using a metadata standard compatible with the one required for the EU Dataset Catalogue of the EHDS (Health DCAT-AP), including its data quality and utility label as defined in the project QUANTUM. Metadata should also cover information about legal conditions and enablers for sharing the respective dataset. Moreover, the action should leverage best practices and strategies for linking clinical and genomic data at individual level, within the framework of EHDS where appropriate, to maximise access to data while preserving the security and privacy of data subjects (e.g. sampling, anonymisation and pseudonymisation techniques, data gap filling). Data minimisation tools should support compliance with the"

An EDIH can select to focus on specific group(s) of clients (e.g. mainly SMEs or mainly public sector).The performance of the hub will be evaluated based on their key performance indicators (KPIs); proposals should define their indicators as well as the targets related to each of them:Number of entities which have used the European Digital Innovation Hubs’ services, by user category (businesses of different sizes, public sector entities, etc.), sector, location, by technology and type of service received. Specific sub-indicators must be proposed when the services are related to develop and uptake AI solutions, and will include a description of which European AI Innovation Infrastructures have been used (such as the AI-on-Demand platform) or referred to (such as the AI Factories).Number of entity referral to European AI Innovation InfrastructuresFor access to finance: amount of additional investments successfully triggered (e.g. through venture capital, bank loan, etc.). Number of collaborations foreseen with other EDIHs and stakeholders outside the region at EU level, and description of jointly shared infrastructures / joint investments with other EDIHs. A set of additional impact indicators will be collected and analysed with the support of the Digital Transformation Accelerator:Increase in digital maturity of organizations that have used the services of the EDIH network. Digital maturity will be defined based on a questionnaire assessing the categories of digital strategy and readiness, intelligence and automation, data and connectedness, sustainable and human-centric digitalisation. EDIHs will administer the questionnaire at the start of the engagement with a client, and later after having delivered services, and report without delay the results to the DTA repository. Increase in number of companies benefiting from the use of European AI technology. Cross-border trans-national hubs are possible with several countries jointly proposing and co-funding cross-border trans-national hubs, serving neighbouring regions in different countries, tackling shared challenges identified in the border regions and exploiting the untapped growth potential in border areas. In this case, only the share of the funding of each country involved in the cross-border trans-national will be considered for the total amount of funding for that country.Objective:The objective is to complete the existing network of European Digital Innovation Hubs (EDIHs) with entities from countries associated to the Digital Europe Programme that have not yet participated in any previous EDIH call. These entities will provide the complete set of services of an EDIH, including the necessary infrastructure, focusing primarily on a specific geographical area and covering the digital transformation needs of the local SMEs, mid-caps and/or public sector organisations with a reinforced AI focus for EDIH operations.The completion of the EDIHs network will be pivotal in supporting the widespread deployment and uptake of European AI technologies, solutions and tool, while also promoting the adoption of other crucial digital technologies, all in alignment with EU values and a human-centric approach.Furthermore, the network will harness the potential of green digital technologies, contributing to Europe’s collective climate and environmental goals. This approach will not only enhance the resilience of European industry but also strengthen its strategic autonomy. With an enhanced presence in countries associated with Digital Europe, the EDIH network will help bridge technology gaps, and support competitiveness and economic convergence.EDIHs will collaborate with EU AI Innovation infrastructures, serving as central hubs for companies and the public sector. They will ensure a flexible and seamless digital journey, referring stakeholders to relevant services provided by these AI innovation infrastructures when appropriate. However, this collaboration does NOT mean that EDIHs need to integrate a representative of each EU AI infrastructures in their own consortium. It means that EDIHs must map out these infrastructures, establish contacts with them and help their customers towards benefiting from available services within a structured client journey. These collaborations will not only accelerate the deployment of AI technologies but also ensure their effective and ethical application. EDIHs will play a pivotal role in bridging the gap between AI research and real-world applications, driving economic growth and improving public services across Europe.The EDIHs will act as a multiplier and widely promote and facilitate the use of all the digital capacities built up under the different specific objectives of the Digital Europe Programme, including the effective use"

Any unused amount from this budget will be allocated with priority to the EIC Accelerator Open call.The support will be in the form of equity-only investments managed by the EIC Fund. Applicants to this call will not receive a grant component. It provides significant financial support, and applicants should apply for an investment of a minimum of EUR 10 million and maximum of EUR 30 million, to co-invest in a funding round in the range of EUR 50 to 150 million, and at least three to five times the amount of the requested EIC contribution. The specific terms of each investment are considered and negotiated on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the EIC Fund Investment Guidelines. This ensures the investment is tailored to your company's needs while aligning with EIC's objectives. EIC STEP Scale Up is designed to fill the funding gap for companies to invest in the scale up of high-risk innovations and where the amount needed for the scale up cannot be fully financed by other investors, including InvestEU direct and indirect financial products provided by implementing partners. Applicants are encouraged to consider in particular complementarity with Venture Debt from InvestEU implementing partners in order to meet their financing needs.When implementing investments, the EIC Fund will ensure that supported companies keep most of their value, including their IP, in the EU or in the Associated Countries in order to contribute to their economic growth and job creation. Where necessary, the EIC Fund will be requested to take appropriate safeguard measures for individual companies on a case-by-case basis in order to protect European interests as defined in the Investment Guidelines.Beyond funding, your company will benefit from a strong support system that fosters your continued growth within Europe through Business Acceleration Services (details available in Section VII). Applicants to the EIC STEP Scale Up call who meet the evaluation thresholds will also be awarded a Sovereignty (STEP) Seal, to facilitate and provide possibility of the access to funding and support from other EU programmes and other funders and investors. Objective:The EIC STEP Scale Up call presents a unique opportunity for ambitious scale up companies (SMEs and small mid-caps) with game-changing innovations in Europe's critical technology areas. It offers a powerful combination of financial and strategic support designed to propel your groundbreaking solution to the forefront of these sectors.The companies selected under the EIC STEP Scale Up call shall receive investments ranging from EUR 10 to EUR 30 million. This investment can significantly accelerate the development and market launch of your technology, product, or service. With this funding, you'll gain the power to disrupt established markets and forge new ones across Europe, potentially achieving significant global impact. Crucially, this investment is designed to catalyse major funding rounds in the range of EUR 50 to 150 million, and at least 3-5 times the EIC investment. This call is part of the implementation of the Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform (STEP) which supports the development or manufacturing of critical technologies throughout the Union or safeguarding and strengthening their respective value chains. Besides, support from the EIC, the projects may be eligible for support under other EU programmes included in STEP. In 2026 support for start-ups in semiconductor technologies and quantum technologies will be pursued in particular through the STEP Scale Up call which foresees larger investments targeting strategic technologies including in support of the Chips Act. The EIC Accelerator Open call remains available in general for startups and SMEs including for quantum and semiconductor technologies.Show more Topic descriptionExpected Outcome:The EIC STEP Scale Up call offers a total indicative budget of EUR 300 million for 2026, which is expected to rise to EUR 900 million for the period 2025-2027.

The applications must cover only one of the two following topics and address at least one of the two specified subtopics (subtopic 1a and/or 1b for topic 1 and subtopic 2a and/or 2b for topic 2); both topics and subtopics are of equal relevance for this call:1. Understanding causes of obesity and overweight and its complications with mechanistic research1a. to investigate biological mechanisms, including chronobiological, genetic and/or epigenetic mechanisms, underlying the onset and progression of overweight and obesity, and related diseases. Secondary factors with potential influence on the biological mechanisms such as the living environment, lifestyle or psychological status should also be considered where relevant.1b. to investigate how overweight and obesity contribute to the development of related clinical complications and/or affect the mechanism of action of therapeutics against other diseases/disorders.2. Prevention and public health strategies for critical transitional periods of lifeBoth subtopics 2a. and 2b. should be addressed for critical transitional periods of life only. The choice of the critical transitional periods of life to be studied must be clearly justified in the proposal. It should be due to biological changes (e.g. postpartum, menopause, andropause), or socio-environmental changes (e.g. period in between pregnancies, diagnosis of a chronic disease, recovering from disease, retirement etc.).2a. to understand and address neglected determinants, including their interdependency, in the onset and the progression of overweight and obesity in transitional periods of life2b. to develop novel tools or preventive strategies that can be implemented against the onset and the progression of overweight and obesity in transitional periods of life taking into consideration physiological, pathophysiological, psychological behavioural influences and/or socioeconomic status of the citizens/patients. Importantly, the proposal should present the assessment of the economic impact of the proposed tools or strategies on the healthcare system, and issue orientations that will help policymakers to define new regulations and guidelines to prevent overweight and obesity.Additional points should be considered beyond the research topics.

Proposals addressing this topic should identify and develop therapies to be used in combination (combination of different antimicrobials, or combination of an antimicrobial and a non-antimicrobial that improves activity or facilitates a better targeting towards the site of infection) to reduce the development of resistance against antibacterial and antifungal treatments and extend the usability of inexpensive and readily available antimicrobials. These studies should be underpinned by scientific rationale and mechanism of action of these treatments. In the framework of this topic, improvement of existing combination treatments is eligible (i.e. pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, mode of administration). The choice of the targeted pathogens should be well justified. For the proposals having a Human Health interest, the proposed combination treatment should be directed against one of the bacterial or fungal pathogens included in the WHO priority lists.-Topic 2: Develop tools and methods to improve adherence to treatment protocols. A low adherence to the treatment protocols by end-users (patients, farmers, citizens) leads to a decreased probability of success and to an increased risk of resistance to antibacterial and antifungal treatments. Proposals addressing this topic should identify the reasons of poor adherence to treatment protocols (Human, Animal, Plant), and/or develop innovative tools (including digital tools) and methods (including sociological and behavioural approaches) to improve the adherence to treatment protocols and/or test and compare the efficiency of existing or innovative tools and methods on the adherence to treatment protocols. Engagement with end-users is mandatory. The consideration of vulnerable groups, which often have reduced access to conventional health and care services, is expected.- Topic 3: Assess the impact of antimicrobials for veterinary and agricultural use on the risk of AMR transmission to humans and the environment to inform policies on the restriction of some antimicrobials for human use. Proposals addressing this topic are expected to assess the impact of mechanisms of action, formulations, routes of administration and treatment regimens of antibacterial and antifungal drugs authorized for veterinary and agricultural use on the risk of emergence and transmission of AMR to humans and the environment. Proposals addressing this topic should also aim to improve the formulation, dosage, delivery, routes of administration and treatment regimens (including pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics) currently used in the veterinary and agricultural sector, to decrease the risk of cross-resistance, or transmission to humans and the environment. The aim is to generate evidence to support policies that restrict certain antimicrobials for exclusive human use and inform policies such as the WHO List of Medically Important Antimicrobials.Submission procedures:-The call will only support transnational research and innovation projects (more details on the composition of the consortium and on the participating funding organisations can be found on the EUP OHAMR Website-https://ohamr.eu/)-The call will follow a two-step evaluation process (submission of a pre-proposal; successful consortia will be invited to submit a full proposal).-Pre-proposals and full proposals must be written in English, and must follow the format and the guidelines provided in the pre-/full"

International collaboration brings diverse academic perspectives and teaching methodologies, enriching the curriculum and broadening students' educational experiences. International master programmes also attract students from around the world, thus increasing diversity and the talent pool, as well as enhancing the universities' reputation and competitiveness on the global stage.By collaborating with institutions from Europe and beyond, universities in Europe can pool resources and knowledge to address pressing global issues such as climate change, digital transformation and sustainable development. In the long run, Erasmus Mundus Design Measures will foster the development of common mechanisms in higher education related to quality assurance, accreditation and recognition of degrees and credits.Therefore, the main objective of the Erasmus Mundus Design Measures is to encourage the development of innovative, highly integrated new international study programmes at Master level. These international study programmes are planned to be jointly delivered by an international consortium of higher education institutions from EU Member States or third countries associated to the programme. Where relevant, also higher education institutions from third countries not associated to the programme can be involved.

The documents for the call are available on the LEAP-RE website.It is highly recommended to submit the final version of the pre / full-proposal well in advance of the deadline to avoid any last-minute technical problems. Requests for extensions of the deadline due to last minute technical problems will not be considered.Evaluation procedure:A two-step evaluation procedure will apply, for the pre-proposals (step 1) and the full proposals (step 2) respectively.Evaluation stage 1: Pre-ProposalsEach eligible pre-proposals will be allocated to at least two International Review Panel (IRP) experts but most of the time three IRP experts designated according to their expertise relevant for the topic of the pre-proposal.Pre-proposals will be assessed based on the three main evaluation criteria: 1) Scientific excellence; 2) Impact and 3) Quality and efficiency of the implementation.The detailed evaluation sub-criteria are available on the call text. In case of strong disagreement between the individual scores by the IRP experts allocated to a pre-proposal (differing 6 or more points between the lowest and the highest individual total scores), the evaluation panel will have a consensus meeting to discuss and agree on the score for each of the three main evaluation criteria in the range of 0–5, resulting in a total score in the range of 0–15.A ranking list will be developed for each multi-annual roadmaps (MAR) with pre-proposals having an average or consensus score at or above 3 for all the three evaluation criteria and a total average or consensus score at or above 10.7 ranked lists (one per MAR) of pre-proposals will be produced by the IRP based on the final scores. The selection of pre-proposals for the stage 2 will be decided at a Call Steering Committee consensus meeting to finalise the stage 1 pre-proposal assessment. A list of eligible proposals of high quality will be invited to submit a full proposal for Stage 2.Evaluation stage 2: Full-ProposalsEach full proposal will be evaluated by the International Review Panel based on three main evaluation criteria listed above . The IRP will consist on at least three members, up to four members for projects of high complexity.The IRP will meet at the panel meeting to discuss all proposals, to produce an assessment report for each full proposal and to rank the lists of full proposals to be considered for funding by the funding organisations. 7 ranking lists (one per multiannual roadmap) will be established for eligible full proposals with overall score of 10 or above and with all the main evaluation criterion scores of 3 or above. Proposals not meeting the thresholds will not be recommended for funding by the IRP.All proposals will be evaluated together (i.e. the multiannual roadmaps will not be treated separately) by the"

It is expected the project will bring about the Network of sites formally constituted and able to take forward the results achieved, and the project activities implemented so far. By ensuring that most resources are allocated directly to site-level and community-wide actions, supported by multilingualism schemes and cross-border collaborations, the project will deliver strong European added value, equitable participation across Member States, and optimal cost-effectiveness of EU investment.Objective:The European Heritage Label (henceforth “EHL”) is one of the most valuable EU initiatives to strengthen European citizens’ sense of belonging to the EU. It is a symbolic action established by the European Union to recognise and celebrate Europe’s shared cultural heritage.Initiated as an intergovernmental initiative and geared up at European Union level in 2011 (Decision No. 1194/2011/EU), the EHL aims to strengthen the sense of belonging among European Union citizens by highlighting and promoting the heritage sites that have played a significant role in the history, culture, and integration of Europe. The EHL is an action focusing on cultural landmarks, that hold a particular significance to the identity of the European Union and intends to further promote their European dimension and foster a greater appreciation for the shared values and history of Europe. In this context, the action plays an essential role in unifying citizens from diverse national backgrounds and enhancing their sense of connection to the European project. Until 2025, a total of 67 sites and 275 locations across 22 EU Member States have been awarded the European Heritage Label, encompassing a diverse range of locations that embody the rich cultural tapestry of the continent. As the number of EHL sites continues to grow, it is essential to centralise the development and exchange of joint practices and activities among them, as well as to formalise and enhance the visibility of the Action both at the local and international levels. The creation of a network of EHL sites, coordinated by a centralised secretariat was a logical next step in the development of the action. This network began with the EHL@Network initiative (2019 - 2022) and evolved into the EHL Bureau (2023-2026) with activities revolving around upskilling, networking, visibility and financing. The EHL Bureau has been instrumental in fostering collaboration among labelled sites, organising upskilling and learning opportunities through regional seminars and workshops and facilitating networking activities during events like the EHL Awards Ceremonies and EHL Days. The EHL Bureau was equally essential in enhancing the overall visibility of the action, creating a cohesive identity for EHL sites and transforming them into an interconnected community of practices. Finally, the EHL Bureau was instrumental in facilitating numerous collaborative initiatives, financing annual cross-borders projects closely aligned on the sites’ needs and the promotion of shared European values.ObjectivesThe general objective of the call is to continue to support the European Heritage Label network of sites, fostering training, exchanges, collaboration and opportunities among the EHL Stakeholders. This call will support a single organisation or a consortium of organisations, with a special focus on cultural heritage and capacity building, which are active in the creative and cultural sectors or running capacity-building and promotional work. The selected project is meant to act as a secretariat for the EHL Network. It will be key to accompany the work of the EHL sites and stakeholders and in ensuring the sustainability of the European Heritage Label, as specified below. The Network, through its secretariat, will support the range of EHL sites and stakeholders and their synergies with bodies active in the field of heritage, cultural and creative sectors together with educational sectors. A strong emphasis will be placed on directing resources towards community-wide actions and site-level projects, in order to generate tangible benefits for citizens while ensuring an efficient and impactful use of funds.It will target the following stakeholders in the EHL initiative:EHL Sites67 Heritage sites representing 275+ locations have been awarded"

Forests provide a multitude of benefits to society in terms of climate regulation, raw materials, habitats for biodiversity, and many other services. Climate change is a major challenge to European forests, as demonstrated by recent heat waves, extended drought periods, and disturbances (e.g., storms, wildfires, insect outbreaks). Increased climate change may lead to shifts in tree species ranges, changes in forest productivity, and increased disturbance damage. Hence, it is important to assess to what extent adaptation measures are needed to counteract and cope with ongoing effects of climate change and forest disturbances.Climate-Smart Forestry (CSF) has been suggested as an approach to connect mitigation with adaptation measures, enhance the resilience of forest resources and ecosystem services, and meet the needs of society , . CSF has been introduced as a holistic approach to guide forest management in Europe and builds on the concept of sustainable forest management, with a strong focus on climate and ecosystem services. Two important components of CSF are to (i) increase carbon storage in forests in conjunction with other ecosystem services, and to (ii) enhance health and resilience through adaptive forest management. CSF aims to have a mix of measures by developing spatially diverse forest management strategies that acknowledge all carbon pools simultaneously to provide longer-term and larger mitigation benefits, while supporting other ecosystem services.Climate change is also an important threat to European forest biodiversity. Despite ambitious policy targets at multiple policy levels, biodiversity is under increasing threat, and degradation of ecosystems continues at an alarming rate. In the EU, the majority of forest habitat and species in protected, as well as managed forests, are in a non-favorable conservation status. As a result, there is a need to restore degraded ecosystems across the EU, including forests, and particularly those with the most potential to capture and store carbon and prevent and reduce the impact of disturbances.To guide forest practitioners on effective CSF and restoration management practices, evidence is needed on how CSF and forest restoration affect forest functioning and can support climate change mitigation, adaptation, and biodiversity in specific regional settings, including uncertainties.Crucial to the successful implementation of CSF is the coordination with citizens and stakeholders. Engaging local communities is vital to ensure that diverse perspectives and local knowledge are justly incorporated into forest management strategies. Stakeholder engagement fosters social learning, where participants can exchange knowledge,"

It is complementary to and works in synergy with other Pact for Skills initiatives.Implementing vocational excellence approaches features prominently in the overall EU policy for skills and VET put forward in the Union of Skills, the European Education Area, the 2020 Council Recommendation on VET, as well as the Osnabrück Declaration and its successor, the Herning Declaration. The CoVE initiative is firmly anchored in the European Pillar of Social Rights, the European Green Deal, the new Digital Strategy, and supports the Industrial and SME Strategies, the Council Recommendation ‘Europe on the Move’ – learning mobility opportunities for everyone, the STEM Education Strategic Plan, and the Clean Industrial Deal.The Union of Skills is an investment in people for a competitive European Union, which needs skilled people to respond to new challenges and stay competitive. It is an initiative that aims to improve the quality of education, training, and lifelong learning and the Centres of Vocational Excellence can contribute to the Union of Skills and the upcoming VET strategy, also through public-private partnerships, expand the use of micro-credentials, etc.Further, this initiative introduces a European dimension to vocational excellence by supporting the implementation of EU VET policy and actions agreed with Member States, social partners and VET providers.OBJECTIVES OF THE ACTIONThe main objective of the CoVE initiative is the establishment and development of transnational collaborative networks that bring together local and regional VET stakeholders (VET institutions, companies and other employers, social partners, authorities, higher education institutions, research institutes, etc.) in strong and broad public-private partnerships, thereby creating comprehensive skills ecosystems for innovation, regional development, and social inclusion and supporting European competitiveness.The Centres of Vocational Excellence aim at achieving the following objectives:to ensure high quality skills through flexible and learner-centred VET provisions that lead to quality employment and career-long opportunities, swiftly responding to the needs of an innovative, inclusive, competitive and sustainable economy as well as to societal needs;to support and act as drivers for local and regional development, innovation and social inclusion;to contribute to upward convergence on VET excellence, to increase the quality of VET at system level in more and more countries;to ensure that outputs and results are taken into use and have impact beyond the project partner organisations and beyond the project period. SCOPE OF THE ACTIONThe CoVEs are expected to develop innovative VET practices, e.g. for use of digital technologies, including AI, contribute to VET attractiveness and inclusion as well as applied research and innovation, facilitate mobility and apprenticeships and professional development of teachers and trainers, work together on joint VET provisions incl. micro-credentials, etc.The Centres of Vocational Excellence operate at two levels:1. At national level, involving a wide range of local stakeholders creating skills ecosystems for local innovation, regional development, and social inclusion, while working with CoVEs in other countries through international collaborative networks.2. At transnational level, bringing together CoVEs that share a common interest in:▪ specific sectors;▪ innovative approaches to tackle economic and societal challenges (e.g. climate change, digitalisation, artificial intelligence, sustainable development goals [See Berlin Declaration on Education for SDG ], integration of migrants and disadvantaged groups, upskilling people with low qualification levels, etc.), or▪ innovative approaches to increase the outreach, quality and effectiveness of existing CoVEs.For more information, see the Erasmus + Programme Guide 2026.Show more Topic descriptionScope:CENTRES OF VOCATIONAL EXCELLENCECentres of Vocational Excellence (CoVE) aim to be a driving force for reforms in the Vocational Education Training (VET) sector, ensuring high quality skills and competences that lead to quality employment and career-long opportunities, meeting the","eu_portal"

Objective: Capacity-building in the field of youth projects are international cooperation projects based on multilateral partnerships between organisations active in the field of youth in the EU and countries associated to the Programme, on the one hand, and in third countries not associated to the Programme, on the other hand. For the latter, this action targets exclusively countries in Region 9 (Sub Saharan Africa). Projects shall aim both at, on one hand, supporting international cooperation in the field of youth and non-formal learning, as a driver of sustainable socio-economic development and well-being among youth organisations and young people and, on the other, at promoting the mobility of young people to encourage their active participation in society as well as to help them acquire and develop competences for life and for their professional future. In specific, projects shall: Raise the capacity of organisations working with young people outside formal learning;Promote non-formal learning in the eligible third countries not associated to the Programme, especially in organisations that target young people with fewer opportunities (through the development, testing and launching of schemes and programmes of non-formal learning mobility in Partner countries);Support the development of youth work in the eligible third countries not associated to the Programme;Foster the development, testing and launching of schemes and programmes allowing organisations to enhance non-formal learning mobility in the eligible third countries not associated to the Programme;Contribute to the achievement of the goals of the Youth Mobility for Africa flagship initiative. This initiative is part of the Global Gateway Africa-Europe Investment Package to increase strategic engagement between the EU and Africa on learning mobility and youth on both continents. The initiative contributes to the Youth Action Plan in External Action (2022-2027) and the commitments made at the 6th EU-African Union Summit in 2022.Support projects that promote the mobility of young people with a view to promoting their active participation in society as well as to helping them acquire and develop competences for life and for their professional future.Foster interregional cooperation;Enhance synergies and complementarities with formal education systems.

Activities under this action should contribute to widening the outreach towards young people to ensure a diversity of voices and reach a diverse range of young people within and beyond youth organisations, including youth with fewer opportunities. They should involve a variety of traditional and digital channels and facilitate the development of partnerships and networks, enabling participation and access for grassroots NGOs and youth movements.European Youth Together projects aim to create networks promoting regional partnerships, to be run in close cooperation with young people from across Europe (EU Member States and third countries associated to the programme). The networks should organise exchanges, promote trainings (for instance for youth leaders) and allow for young people themselves to set up joint projects, all of which can be done through both physical and online activities.OBJECTIVES OF THE ACTIONEuropean Youth Together projects aim to create cooperation, enabling young people across Europe to set up joint projects, organise exchanges and promote trainings (e.g. for youth leaders/ youth workers) through both physical and online activities. The action will support transnational partnerships for youth organisations from both grassroots and large-scale level, aiming to reinforce the European dimension of their activities.Important thematic priorities are working with and promoting the EU Youth Strategy 2019-2027 [1] and the European Youth Goals. The European Youth Goals are also reflected in the President von der Leyen Commission’s political guidelines [2]. Project proposals may also treat the legacy of the European Year of Youth 2022 (e.g., exploration of youth check or youth mainstreaming processes) and the outcomes of the ‘Conference for the Future of Europe’ [Conference on the Future of Europe - European Commission].Youth networks should consider ways of forging solidarity and inclusiveness in the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.SPECIFIC OBJECTIVESThe action seeks to specifically support at least one of the following specific objectives:• the promotion and development of more transnational structured cooperation, online and offline, between different youth organisations to build or strengthen partnerships focusing on solidarity and inclusive democratic participation of all against a backdrop of the backlashes on socio-economic structures and in line with the EU Youth Strategy 2019- 2027, the European Youth Goals, the EU Youth Dialogue and the European Year of Youth 2022 legacy (e.g. youth participation, youth mainstreaming, youth check processes).• the promotion of the six core EU values [3] that form the basis of our society: Respect for human dignity; Freedom; Democracy; Equality, Rule of law and Respect for human rights, including those of minorities.• youth organisations involved in initiatives to encourage young people to participate in the democratic process and in society by organising trainings, showcase commonalities among young Europeans and encourage discussion and debate on their connection to the EU, its values and democratic foundations. This includes organising events linked to the promotion of participation of under-represented groups of young people in politics, youth organisations and other civil society organisations by engaging youth with fewer opportunities such as vulnerable and socio-economic disadvantaged youth and young people from rural and remote areas.• new ways to empower youth organisations, by supporting innovative ways of cooperation and network creation, development and management. Indicatively, this could include enhancing collaboration between youth organisations in a digital context through non-formal learning methods and organisational models such as alternative modes of exchanges and mutual aid. The Declaration of the 4 th European Youth Work Convention of May 2025 and the roadmap for a European Youth Work Strategy should be a new supportive framework for the implementation of the European Youth Work Agenda.• the reinforcement of the European dimension of the activities of grassroots youth organisations, including activities on how to live better together and helping to design sustainable future ways of living transnationally, in line with the European Green Deal and the New European","eu_portal"

International partnerships should contribute to improving the quality of VET in the third countries not associated to the Programme, notably by reinforcing the capacities of VET staff and teachers as well as by strengthening the link between VET providers and the labour market.It is envisaged that the capacity building projects VET contribute to the broader policy objectives that are being pursued between the European Commission and the third countries not associated to the Programme or region concerned, including Global Gateway investment packages and the development of Talent partnerships and the Talent pool as laid down in the Commission Communication on attracting skills and talent to the EU of April 2022.OBJECTIVES OF THE ACTIONSpecifically, the action will:Build capacity of VET providers to strengthen cooperation between private and public stakeholders in the field of vocational education and training for demand-oriented and opportunity-driven VET interventions;Improve the quality and responsiveness of VET to socio-economic opportunities and social developments to enhance the labour market relevance of skills provision;Align VET provision to local, regional and national development strategies.

They make it possible for every young person to access high-quality international and cross-cultural education without physical mobility. While virtual debating or training does not fully replace the benefits of physical mobility, participants in virtual exchanges ought to reap some of the benefits of the international educational experience. Digital platforms represent a valuable tool in partially answering the global constraints on mobility caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Virtual exchanges also help spreading European values. Moreover, in some cases, virtual exchanges can give ideas and prepare the ground for future physical exchanges not funded under this action.Virtual exchanges in higher education and youth take place in small groups and are always moderated by a trained facilitator. They should be easily integrated into youth (non-formal education) projects or higher education courses. Virtual exchanges can draw participants from both sectors, even if, depending on specific projects, they could involve participants from either only one of them or from both. All projects under this call will involve organisations and participants coming from both EU Member States and third countries associated to the Programme, and third countries not associated to the Programme in eligible regions.OBJECTIVES OF THE ACTIONThe action will aim to:encourage intercultural dialogue with third countries not associated to the Programme and increase tolerance through online people-to-people interactions, building on digital, youth-friendly technologies;promote various types of virtual exchanges as a complement to Erasmus+ physical mobility, allowing more young people to benefit from intercultural and international experience;enhance critical thinking and media literacy, particularly in the use of internet and social media, such as to counter discrimination, indoctrination, polarization and violent radicalisation;foster the digital and soft skills1 development of students, young people and youth workers2 , including the practice of foreign languages and teamwork, notably to enhance employability;promote citizenship and the common values of freedom, tolerance and non-discrimination through education;strengthen the youth dimension in the relations of the EU with third countries. THEMATIC AREAS / SPECIFIC OBJECTIVESThe virtual exchanges should be organised in one or more of the following thematic areas, which correspond to the priorities of the Erasmus+ Programme:Inclusion and diversity;Digital transformation;Environment and fight against climate change;Participation in democratic life, common values and civic engagement. Within this broad framework, since virtual exchanges are a bottom-up initiative, participating organisations are free to choose the topics on which they will focus, but proposals must demonstrate their expected impact in relation to one or more of the objectives mentioned above (see also ‘Expected impact’ section below). Gender aspects should be taken into account as needed, depending on the projects’ scope and themes (e.g. by introducing gender sensitivity aspects in the trainings). Special attention needs to be given to the inclusion of socially and economically vulnerable people and persons unable to apply for physical mobility.Further information can be found on the dedicated page of the Programme Guide (erasmus-plus.ec.europa.eu/erasmus-programme-guide), please check the latest version for 2026.1 Soft skills include the ability to think critically, be curious and creative, to take initiative, to solve problems and work collaboratively, to be able to communicate efficiently in a multicultural and interdisciplinary environment, to be able to adapt to context and to cope with stress and uncertainty. These skills are part of the key competences, as outlined in the Council Recommendation on Key Competences for Lifelong Learning (OJ C 189/1 of 4.6.2018).2 Youth workers are professional or volunteers involved in non-formal learning who support young people in their personal socio-educational and professional development.Show more Topic descriptionScope:ERASMUS+ VIRTUAL EXCHANGESVirtual exchanges projects consist of online people-to-people activities that promote intercultural dialogue and soft skills development.

They make it possible for every young person to access high-quality international and cross-cultural education without physical mobility. While virtual debating or training does not fully replace the benefits of physical mobility, participants in virtual exchanges ought to reap some of the benefits of the international educational experience. Digital platforms represent a valuable tool in partially answering the global constraints on mobility caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Virtual exchanges also help spreading European values. Moreover, in some cases, virtual exchanges can give ideas and prepare the ground for future physical exchanges not funded under this action.Virtual exchanges in higher education and youth take place in small groups and are always moderated by a trained facilitator. They should be easily integrated into youth (non-formal education) projects or higher education courses. Virtual exchanges can draw participants from both sectors, even if, depending on specific projects, they could involve participants from either only one of them or from both. All projects under this call will involve organisations and participants coming from both EU Member States and third countries associated to the Programme, and third countries not associated to the Programme in eligible regions.OBJECTIVES OF THE ACTIONThe action will aim to:encourage intercultural dialogue with third countries not associated to the Programme and increase tolerance through online people-to-people interactions, building on digital, youth-friendly technologies;promote various types of virtual exchanges as a complement to Erasmus+ physical mobility, allowing more young people to benefit from intercultural and international experience;enhance critical thinking and media literacy, particularly in the use of internet and social media, such as to counter discrimination, indoctrination, polarization and violent radicalisation;foster the digital and soft skills1 development of students, young people and youth workers2 , including the practice of foreign languages and teamwork, notably to enhance employability;promote citizenship and the common values of freedom, tolerance and non-discrimination through education;strengthen the youth dimension in the relations of the EU with third countries. THEMATIC AREAS / SPECIFIC OBJECTIVESThe virtual exchanges should be organised in one or more of the following thematic areas, which correspond to the priorities of the Erasmus+ Programme:Inclusion and diversity;Digital transformation;Environment and fight against climate change;Participation in democratic life, common values and civic engagement. Within this broad framework, since virtual exchanges are a bottom-up initiative, participating organisations are free to choose the topics on which they will focus, but proposals must demonstrate their expected impact in relation to one or more of the objectives mentioned above (see also ‘Expected impact’ section below). Gender aspects should be taken into account as needed, depending on the projects’ scope and themes (e.g. by introducing gender sensitivity aspects in the trainings). Special attention needs to be given to the inclusion of socially and economically vulnerable people and persons unable to apply for physical mobility.Further information can be found on the dedicated page of the Programme Guide (erasmus-plus.ec.europa.eu/erasmus-programme-guide), please check the latest version for 2026.1 Soft skills include the ability to think critically, be curious and creative, to take initiative, to solve problems and work collaboratively, to be able to communicate efficiently in a multicultural and interdisciplinary environment, to be able to adapt to context and to cope with stress and uncertainty.

They also aim to boost the provision of new skills and address skills mismatches by designing and creating new curricula for higher education (HE) and vocational education and training (VET), supporting the development of a sense of initiative and entrepreneurial mind-sets in the EU. OBJECTIVES OF THE ACTION These partnerships shall implement a coherent and comprehensive set of sectoral or cross-sectoral activities, which should be adaptable to future knowledge developments across the EU. To boost innovation, the focus will be on talent and skills development. Firstly, digital competences have become increasingly important in all job profiles across the entire labour market. Secondly, the transition to a circular and greener economy needs to be underpinned by changes to qualifications and national education and training curricula to meet emerging professional needs for green skills and sustainable development. Thirdly, the twin digital and green transition requires an accelerated adoption of new technologies across all sectors of our economy and society and boosting STEM skills and talent. Lot 2: Alliances for Sectoral Cooperation on Skills (implementing the ‘Blueprint’) Alliances for Sectoral Cooperation on Skills aim to create new strategic approaches and cooperation for concrete skills development solutions – both in the short and the medium term – in areas implementing a major action of the European Skills Agenda for sustainable competitiveness, social fairness and resilience, the Pact for Skills, an action launched under the European Skills Agenda in 2020 and now a major element of the sector based approach of the Union of Skills, the overarching European skills strategy. The initiative provides large-scale partnerships established under the Pact for Skills, with the opportunity to support the development of sector skills strategies, as well as the revision and development of job profiles and of related training programmes. The main objective of the Pact is to mobilise and incentivize all relevant stakeholders and leverage public-private partnerships to take concrete actions for the upskilling and reskilling of the workforce, by pooling efforts and setting up partnerships, also at EU level, addressing the needs of the labour market, supporting green and digital transitions as well as national, regional and local skills and growth strategies. Therefore, the deliverables of Alliances for Sectoral Cooperation on Skills, i.e. sectoral skills intelligence, skills strategies, occupational profiles, training programmes, and long-term planning, will be an important contribution to the work of the ecosystem-based large-scale partnerships that have joined the Pact for Skills. Alliances for Sectoral Cooperation on Skills seek to tackle skills gaps on the labour market that hamper growth, innovation and competitiveness in specific sectors or areas, aiming both at short term interventions and long-term strategies. These Alliances will be implemented in the 14 industrial ecosystems identified in the New Industrial Strategy for Europe1 (see eligibility criteria).

Thirdly, the twin digital and green transition requires an accelerated adoption of new technologies across all sectors of our economy and society and boosting STEM skills and talent.Lot 1: Alliances for Education and EnterprisesAlliances for Education and Enterprises are transnational, structured and result-driven projects, in which partners share common goals and work together to foster innovation, new skills, a sense of initiative and entrepreneurial mind-sets.They aim to foster innovation in higher education, vocational education and training, enterprises and the broader socio-economic environment. This includes confronting societal and economic challenges such as climate change, changing demographics, digitisation, the emergence of new, disruptive technologies such as artificial intelligence generating demand for STEM skills and talent and rapid employment changes through social innovation and community resilience as well as labour market innovation. In 2026, this topic will also address the challenge of severe skills gaps in sectors crucial for Europe’s competitiveness in line with the Union of Skills initiative.Alliances for Education and Enterprises bring together enterprises and both higher education and vocational training providers to work together in partnership. Operating within one economic sector or several different economic sectors, they create reliable and sustainable relations and demonstrate their innovative and transnational character in all aspects. While each partnership must include at least one VET and one higher education organisation, they can address either both or one of these educational fields. The cooperation between VET and higher education organisations should be relevant and should benefit both sectors.They intend to achieve one or more of the following aims:Fostering new, innovative and multidisciplinary approaches to teaching and learning: fostering innovation in education design and delivery, teaching methods, assessment techniques, learning environments and/or developing new skills;Supporting skills development in the STEM domains; supporting Europe’s innovation capacity by broadening its talent pool for new, disruptive technologies;Fostering the setting up of incubators within education and training institutions across Europe;Fostering corporate social responsibility (e.g. equity, inclusion, climate change, environmental protection and sustainable development); Stimulating a sense of initiative and entrepreneurial attitudes, mind-sets and skills in learners, educational staffand other workers, in line with the Entrepreneurship Competence Framework (EntreComp)[ https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC101581/lfna27939enn.pdf];Improving the quality and relevance of skills developed and certified through education and training systems (including new skills and tackling skills mismatches);Facilitating the exchange and co-creation of knowledge between higher education and vocational education and training, research, the public sector and the business sector;Building and supporting effective and efficient higher education and vocational education and training systems, which are connected, inclusive and contribute to innovation.Supporting dedicated joint programmes or developing jointly micro-credentials and supporting mentorship for start up and scale ups in sectors crucial for Europe’s competitiveness where severe skills gaps occur. Higher education institutions are encouraged to use the HEInnovate self-assessment tool [ https://heinnovate.eu/en] before applying, above all if they are coordinating the proposal. HEInnovate will help them identify their strengths and weaknesses in terms of entrepreneurship and innovation. The proposal and the consortium composition can therefore be better prepared and combine all the necessary expertise.Show more Topic descriptionScope:ALLIANCES FOR INNOVATIONAlliances for Innovation aim to strengthen Europe’s innovation capacity by boosting innovation through cooperation and flow of knowledge among higher education, vocational education and training","eu_portal"

Aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement, it supports quality, modernisation, and responsiveness in higher education to address socio-economic recovery and global challenges. The action is expected to contribute to the overarching priorities pre-defined by the European Commission.It also contributes to broader EU external policy goals, including Global Gateway initiatives and the Pact for the Mediterranean.For more information, please consult the call document (Programme Guide).

Please also note that there is a flexibility of transferring budgets between the Strands.

For Strands 1 and 2, the applicable priorities are further detailed in the regional context as follows: Green Deal: Two main elements have a critical impact on the Caribbean: i) climate change and natural disasters and ii) unsustainable production and excessive generation of waste. Both put the Caribbean marine and terrestrial ecosystems under pressure and vulnerable to external shocks. Projects should contribute to adapt to climate change and reduce risks in areas as transition to low-carbon economies, renewable energy, waste management, agri-food value chains.Digital transformation: The regional Multiannual Indicative Programme for Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) region generally advances the external dimension of EC priorities, notably for digital transformation. In an island region, investment in digital skills, infrastructure and inclusion is required: at LAC level, the EU has created an EU-LAC Digital Alliance to pursue each element of this agenda, while digital cooperation is embedded with within the connectivity dimension of Global Gateway, and BELLA (Building Europe Link to Latin America) connects universities and innovation centres in EU, Latin America and Caribbean.Governance, peace, security and human development: To contribute to more inclusive and resilient societies and advance on social cohesion, projects should create knowledge, awareness as well as capacity in areas as education, health, gender equality and inclusiveness.Sustainable growth and jobs: Developing knowledge, in connection with the labour market needs, in areas with growth potential (such as creative industries and services) and emerging sectors (blue, green, and digital economy) can generate a multiplying effect. Projects can contribute to find regional solutions to common challenges such as connectivity and regional integration, as well reducing youth unemployment rates and brain drain.For those proposals that also refer to an Erasmus+ Global Gateway relevant priority, applicants should select the ‘Global Gateway’ fixed keyword in the relevant field, alongside any other fixed keyword options relevant to their proposal.For Strand 3 and given the nature of the strand, which aims at supporting structural reforms in the third countries not associated to the Programme, proposals must address the needs of higher education in the country(ies) concerned at large. In this Region, Strand 3 proposals must be aligned with the Erasmus+ Global Gateway-related priorities defined at country (or cluster of countries) level - see hyperlink below.These priorities are available under the corresponding table of the following link: https://international-partnerships.ec.europa.eu/policies/global-gateway/erasmus-global-gateway-priorities_enApplicants submitting proposals in this Strand under Region 11 – Caribbean should propose academic capacity building aspects that well align with the Global Gateway investment priorities and projects for the country/region concerned. This requirement is essential and will be carefully evaluated as part of the Relevance award criterion.In addition, each applicant will need to identify in Part A of the application form one of the overarching priorities, which are defined by the European Commission and reflected in the Programme Guide. This is compulsory. Please note multiple priorities cannot be selected.Beyond the applicable overarching priorities of Erasmus+ and Global Gateway-related priorities, and in order","eu_portal"

For Strands 1 and 2, the applicable priorities are further detailed in the regional context as follows: Green Deal: One of the objectives of the EU in the Region is to accelerate the transition towards a green and circular economy, as Central Asia has a great potential for green energy. Projects should thus accelerate the transition towards a green and circular economy and tackle trans-regional environmental challenges through accompanying links with the private sector as well as enhanced study and educational capacities.Digital transformation: The EU’s Central Asia strategy - re-affirmed in the 2025 EU-Central Asia Summit - is built around cooperation on digital connections, transport, energy and people-to-people contacts. Projects should focus on improving the digital economy and digital infrastructure for skills development and job creation.Sustainable growth and jobs: The development of skills will be key to Central Asia’s competitiveness and social cohesion.

For Strands 1 and 2, the applicable priorities are further detailed in the regional context as follows:Green Deal: Support the modernisation of economies, making them more competitive and innovative, while ensuring the green transition towards climate neutrality. Research & innovation initiatives are to focus upon climate change mitigation and adaptation, the greening of cities, promotion and implementation of new sustainable value chains and green skills & jobs. Academic cooperation should help provide answers to public demands on urban and rural development, energy efficiency, health and natural resource and waste management.Digital transformation: Foster an effective, inclusive and gender-sensitive digital transformation in education and science, in the first place by addressing the digital skills gap. Priority areas in the digital strand include the development of connectivity solutions empowering citizens through the improvement of digital skills and digital literacy, distance learning, and learning and teaching innovations, specifically in remote and rural areas and vulnerable communities. Priority should also be given to fostering links between Education, Research and Business in the area of digitalisation. Calls related to Data infrastructure, Data management and SME/business digitalisation are encouraged.Integration of migrants: Support education initiatives contributing to the development of a regional higher education area, particularly credit transfer systems and qualification, degree and credential recognition. Provide for the integration of migrants and displaced persons by granting access to education, including language education and scholarships.Governance, peace, security and human development: Contribute to an area of democracy, prosperity, stability, security and increased cooperation between resilient and inclusive societies sharing common values. Projects should notably focus on rule of law reforms, protection of human rights, the fight against corruption and discrimination, media literacy, the role of an independent media and civil society and promotion of gender equality.Sustainable growth and jobs: Investing in young people and better connecting education, research and innovation with private sector needs are crucial building blocks in achieving economies that work for all. Areas of particular focus are teacher training, youth entrepreneurship, the offer and uptake of Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Maths (STEAM) skills, and related gender inclusiveness.

For Strands 1 and 2, the applicable priorities are further detailed in the regional context as follows: Green Deal: Projects should contribute to an inclusive, long-term socio-economic recovery and tap into the Region’s economic potential by supporting the circular and green economy as well as urban development. Priorities include increasing climate awareness, sustainability and resilience, specifically in the key sectors of agriculture, energy and water management. Furthermore, academic cooperation should aim to provide applicable answers to environmental challenges, including desertification, biodiversity loss and use of natural resources.Digital transformation: Projects should seize the digital transition by working on digital literacy, skills and entrepreneurship. In parallel, digital solutions can provide new means to reach out to vulnerable communities. Cooperation opportunities also lie in digital infrastructure and connections, where heightened reliability, capacity and security will support regional economic integration.Integration of migrants: Education access for displaced persons and refugees is a priority objective for the entire Region. Support intra-regional initiatives on credential and degree recognition as well as regional credit transfer systems. Opportunities and jobs, as referred to in the other regional priorities, should be inclusive of all, including migrants and displaced persons.Governance, peace, security and human development: Commitment to the rule of law, human and fundamental rights, equality, democracy and good governance are the bedrock of stable, fair and prosperous societies. Initiatives on peace and security, intercultural dialogue and women empowerment are encouraged, hereby driving respect for diversity, tolerance and strengthening the Mediterranean partnership.Sustainable growth and jobs: Improving education systems governance and addressing structural causes of schools dropouts are crucial to meet youth aspirations and to address persisting economic and gender inequalities. An integral part to this process is developing primary and secondary teacher education and in-service training. Stronger linkages between the academic, research and business world are to be stimulated, with education programmes addressing current and future skills needs, not in the least entrepreneurship. Innovation hubs and start-ups help generate local employment opportunities and prevent brain drain.

For Strands 1 and 2, the applicable priorities are further detailed in the regional context as follows: Green Deal: There is no other Region in the world more threatened by climate change and engaged in climate action, as environmental degradation greatly hampers deeper development in the Pacific. Projects should therefore help to modernise economies in the Region by establishing links with the private sector, as well as creating knowledge and capacity to help the Region further adapt to climate change and a changing work dynamic. Digital transformation: Digital governance and partnerships as well as connectivity both feature as one of the seven priority areas for the EU’s strategy for cooperation in the Indo-Pacific and the 2023 Digital Compass. The digital transition is a priority for Global Gateway value chain priorities for individual countries, which face the challenges of distance and insularity. Digitalisation also plays an important role in strategies for transport, while digital governance is a building block in the EU’s relations with the wider Asia-Pacific region. Sustainable growth and jobs: The countries of the Pacific Region suffer from a very narrow market size, offering very few job opportunities. Projects should support the creation of stable and reliable internal repositories of knowledge and competencies, avoiding a brain drain and enhancing the domestic education systems. In this respect, one of the main cornerstones will be the development of the “blue economy” concept. For those proposals that also refer to an Erasmus+ Global Gateway relevant priority, applicants should select the ‘Global Gateway’ fixed keyword in the relevant field, alongside any other fixed keyword options relevant to their proposal.For Strand 3 and given the nature of the strand, which aims at supporting structural reforms in the third countries not associated to the Programme, proposals must address the needs of higher education in the country(ies) concerned at large. In this Region, Strand 3 proposals must be aligned with the Erasmus+ Global Gateway-related priorities defined at country (or cluster of countries) level - see hyperlink below.These priorities are available under the corresponding table of the following link:https://international-partnerships.ec.europa.eu/policies/global-gateway/erasmus-global-gateway-priorities_enApplicants submitting proposals in this Strand under Region 8a – Pacific should propose academic capacity building aspects that well align with the Global Gateway investment priorities and projects for the country/region concerned. This requirement is essential and will be carefully evaluated as part of the Relevance award criterion.In addition, each applicant will need to identify in Part A of the application form one of the overarching priorities, which are defined by the European Commission and reflected in the Programme Guide.

Priority areas include climate, environment, circular economy and fighting pollution. Projects should pave the way to a climate neutral society by supporting reforms of education systems in order to guarantee that people are equipped and prepared for the labour market and society of tomorrow.Digital transformation: Projects should support the development and uptake of digital skills to make the digital transformation as comprehensive and inclusive as possible.

Project proposals centred on health governance are encouraged, particularly those linked to preparedness and resilience.Sustainable growth and jobs: Quality education is a key factor for securing growth and jobs and for addressing challenges linked to unemployment and skills mismatches. Investing in human capital and entrepreneurship helps societies to prepare for the future, by putting a halt to brain drain and supporting the transition to a knowledge-based economy.

Research & innovation initiatives are to focus upon climate change mitigation and adaptation, the greening of cities, promotion and implementation of new sustainable value chains and green skills & jobs. Academic cooperation should help provide answers to public demands on urban and rural development, energy efficiency, health and natural resource and waste management.Digital transformation: Foster an effective, inclusive and gender-sensitive digital transformation in education and science, in the first place by addressing the digital skills gap. Priority areas in the digital strand include the development of connectivity solutions empowering citizens through the improvement of digital skills and digital literacy, distance learning, and learning and teaching innovations, specifically in remote and rural areas and vulnerable communities. Priority should also be given to fostering links between Education, Research and Business in the area of digitalisation. Calls related to Data infrastructure, Data management and SME/business digitalisation are encouraged.Integration of migrants: Support education initiatives contributing to the development of a regional higher education area, particularly credit transfer systems and qualification, degree and credential recognition.","eu_portal"

For Strands 1 and 2, the applicable priorities are further detailed in the regional context as follows: Green Deal: Latin American countries are key partners for a global transition towards a greener and climate neutral development path. The Region is home to around of 50% of the global biodiversity and has a tremendous potential for renewable, but also is highly vulnerable to negative impacts of climate change and natural disasters. Projects should respond to those environmental challenges enhancing capacities in the Region. Projects should also support the private sector for their green and economic transition and enhance the needed knowledge and skills. Digital transformation: Digital transformation can support sustainable recovery in Latin American countries, address traps and increase competitiveness. Projects should help to bridge the digital divide, developing digital literacy and skills, as well as scientific, technical and innovation capacities fostering links between education, research and business. Earth observation and spatial technologies allow increasing climate change mitigation and creating innovation paths. Governance, peace, security and human development: Strengthening social cohesion remains a priority for the Region, which is the most unequal of the world. Projects should contribute to build inclusive societies by developing awareness and strengthening capacities in areas such as education, health, gender equality, access and inclusion, human rights, including social, economic, and cultural rights. Particular attention should be given to vulnerable communities as well as remote and rural areas. Projects support intra-regional connectivity and contribute to the development of the Higher Education Area, particularly the recognition of degrees and credit transfer systems and qualifications. Projects should support the integration of migrants, refugees and displaced persons as well, through the access to education. Sustainable growth and jobs: To accompany the Region to a sustainable inclusive economic recovery, projects should put the accent to respond to the needs of emerging sectors, as green, blue, digital and orange economy. Projects should also help to identify education gaps in the different areas in close cooperation with the private sector. For those proposals that also refer to an Erasmus+ Global Gateway relevant priority, applicants should select the ‘Global Gateway’ fixed keyword in the relevant field, alongside any other fixed keyword options relevant to their proposal.For Strand 3 and given the nature of the strand, which aims at supporting structural reforms in the third countries not associated to the Programme, proposals must address the needs of higher education in the country(ies) concerned at large.

It brings together six Living Labs (LLs) in the Basque Country, Bulgaria, Greece, Italy, Spain, and Sweden, fostering co-creation among farmers, researchers, SMEs, NGOs, and public administrations.Through this Open Call (OC), iCOSHELLs will fund and integrate new stakeholders and prototypes (innovative practices, technologies, or tools) to be tested in real-life conditions within its six Living Labs. Selected applicants will become full members of the iCOSHELLs network, actively participating in co-creation activities and solution validation for soil restoration and sustainable management.Each LL focuses on specific regional challenges such as:Soil structure and biodiversity improvement (Sweden, Italy)Reduction of salinity and pollution (Spain, Greece)Circular and community-driven restoration (Basque Country)Sustainable viticulture and erosion control (Bulgaria)ELIGIBLE APPLICANTSThe call will be limited to single applicants, natural persons or legal entities, although it will be allowed to use part of the funding to subcontract specific activities. Applicants, which are considered eligible under the Horizon Europe rules (residing in one of the eligible countries described in the Horizon Europe general annexes to the Work Programme) , include:Landowners or land managers (e.g. farmers)Academic or Research organisationsSmall and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs)Public administrationsRepresentatives of civil society (e.g. consumers, environmental NGOs)Eligible applicants should have the capacity to conduct field testing. The following additional conditions apply to any eligible applicant:The applicant should not have been declared bankrupt or have initiated bankruptcy procedures.The entities applying should not have convictions for fraudulent behaviour, other financial irregularities, and unethical or illegal business practices.There should not be any conflict of interest with any of the iCOSHELLs beneficiaries, as detailed in Section “Conflict of Interest”.No double funding is allowed.All the above will be assessed based on the declarations completed in the Application Form. If any of the required conditions are not met, the proposal will be considered ineligible.Multiple submissionsThe iCOSHELLs OC is a competitive funding call. Multiple applications are possible under this call. In these cases, applicants need to submit one application form per project proposal.SUBMISSION PROCESSThe application procedures are described in more detail in the Guide for Applicants available at https://www.icoshells.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/iCOSHELLs_Open-Call_Guide-for-Applicants_EN2.pdfDeadlineThe deadline for submissions to the iCOSHELLs OC is February 04, 2026 (14:00 h CET). Only proposals submitted before the deadline will be accepted. After the call closure no additions or changes to received proposals will be taken into account.It is strongly recommended that applicants do not wait until the last minute to submit their proposal.

Through possible involvement of appropriate actors across the value chain – from materials, substrate, equipment, and test providers through packaging companies and their European customers – proposed projects should build a strong European innovation and transfer ecosystem for advanced packaging solutions, contributing to new and resilient supply chains in Europe. Expected Outcome: This topic will open up new opportunities for European-based semiconductor packaging companies and their supply chain by building on currently available services of RTOs and all Chips JU pilot lines. The LFA projects should prepare and speed up the transfer of technologies from pilot lines to industrial deployment.

promote solidarity across the participating countries; enable the young people to gain skills and competences which are useful for their personal, educational, social and professional development;- provide tangible benefits to the communities within which the activities are carried out;- ensure a direct contact between the participant and the beneficiaries of the solidarity-related activities, to enable the participant to gain skills that are useful for their educational and social development;- reach out to young people with fewer opportunities, including refugees, asylum seekers and migrants;- promote diversity, intercultural and inter-religious dialogue - and the EU values of human dignity, freedom, equality and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities - as well as projects enhancing media literacy, critical thinking and a sense of initiative among young people;- reinforce the capacities and international scope of the participating organisations;- Boost solidarity between different age groups, increase understanding and combat inequalities;- raise young volunteers’ awareness and understanding of other cultures and countries, offering them the opportunity to build networks of international contacts, to actively participate in society and to develop a sense of European citizenship and identity.Scope:WHAT ARE THE PRIORITIES OF 2026 CALL FOR THIS ACTION?ENHANCING A CULTURE OF PREPAREDNESS ACROSS THE WHOLE OF SOCIETY AND PROVIDING RELIEF TO PERSONS FLEEING ARMED CONFLICTS AND OTHER VICTIMS OF DISASTER FROM NATURAL HAZARDS AND HUMAN-INDUCED RISKSThe Corps can contribute to developing a culture of preparedness that can help people across the whole of society, with particular attention to the most vulnerable groups, adapt to change and risks such as those related to health, security, economy or any other emerging threat. The Corps can also add significant value by contributing to the provision of relief and assistance to those whose lives, livelihoods and communities have been disrupted by disasters from natural hazards and human-induced risks, including armed conflicts. The importance of solidarity among individuals and communities, within or across borders, has become even more apparent with the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the resulting big inflow of displaced people into the EU, frequent occurrences of extreme weather events (e.g. floods and forest fires) as well as large-scale seismic events in certain countries. It is crucial to use the Corps’ potential to implement community-based activities that foster sustained empathy and solidarity among young people and also facilitate exchange and cooperation between people from different backgrounds.FOSTERING POSITIVE LEARNING EXPERIENCES AND OUTCOMES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE WITH FEWER OPPORTUNITIESThe Corps can provide significant value by assisting children and young people from disadvantaged backgrounds, with disabilities or otherwise vulnerable groups with the attainment of adequate learning achievements, including improving basic skills. This can be done through organising recreational and educational activities for children and young people, as well as through mentoring that supplements formal learning. The volunteers should support young people and children to strengthen their literacy, numeracy, science, digital and citizenship skills to boost their creativity, innovation and critical thinking. The European Year of Youth and the European Year of Skills have fostered the efforts in reaching out to all young people, including those with fewer opportunities. The Commission Communication “Putting people first, securing sustainable and inclusive growth, unlocking the potential of the EU’s outermost regions” underlines that the European Solidarity Corps inclusion and diversity strategy helps young people from these regions to participate in the programme. The European Commission Action Plan on Basic Skills highlights that the European Solidarity Corps will enable supportive environments for developing basic skills.ENHANCING INTERGENERATIONAL FAIRNESS AND SOLIDARITYThis action can provide significant value by promoting activities intended to enhance intergenerational fairness and solidarity. It can support development of skills aimed at understanding intergenerational fairness","eu_portal"

Activities must cover a number of the following elements:Benchmarking the NAMs against state-of-the-art animal models and/or human trialsDemonstration in relevant application, such as disease modelling, or testing of medicinal products and medical technologies for safety, efficacy, or qualityOrganisation of consultation meetings/workshops with industrial end users, regulators, CROs (Contract Research Organisations), standard setting bodies or other relevant stakeholders to gather further needs and feedbackEngagement with infrastructures for testing and data collection as testing and validation of the NAM outside the developer’s labDevelopment of regulatory-grade data packages suitable for submission to relevant agencies (e.g. EMA, FDA, OECD), andDocumentation on scalability, standardisation, and potential barriers to uptake. During the project’s implementation phase, beneficiaries will be encouraged to consider using the EU Reference Laboratory for alternatives to animal testing (EURL ECVAM) of the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre for aspects of standardisation, automation and validation of in vitro methods. These facilities operate and provide support at the interface between pre-normative research, regulatory sciences and innovation.Scope:New Approach Methodologies (NAMs) have the potential to replace, reduce or refine animal use in the testing96 of medicinal products. Scientific progress in recent decades has delivered several animal-free NAMs that have the potential to transform how we understand human biology and assess the safety, efficacy, and quality testing in the health sector. However, a lack of knowledge, experience and confidence in the use of such novel methodologies has limited their adoption by end users, including, for example, industry and regulators.This Challenge competition therefore looks to accelerate the adoption of NAMs in biomedicine and support companies that want to bring NAMs to the market. Applicants should propose innovative and disruptive NAMs addressing one or both of the following areas:Preclinical biomedical researchTesting of medicinal products and medical technologies for safety, efficacy, or quality. Human organoids or microphysiological systems (e.g. organ-on-chip, disease-on-chip), in chemico methods, digital twins, virtual patient simulations, AI-enhanced predictive models, mechanistic or integrated in silico platforms, 3D- advanced human tissue model are in scope.Applicants to this Challenge call should already have:Proven the viability of their proposed solution in a lab environment at TRL 4 (lab or in silico);Have letters of intent of at least one of the following stakeholders: an industrial end-user or regulatory body interested in the proposed project; andHave access to an appropriate infrastructure to carry out the planned activities in Stage 1 and 2.
